      "A few foreign well-known ornamental species are cultivated in China, including the florist's gloxinia, Sinningia speciosa (Loddiges) Hiern, and African violet, Saintpaulia ionantha Wendland. The two ovary carpels may each produce a stigma; these stigmas are fused into a single structure. Some students of Gesneriaceae have considered the stigma to be single and either simple (capitate) or 2-lobed, whereas others consider each of the two stigmas as units. We have maintained the latter usage, but a family-wide investigation of stigma development is needed. The distinction can be blurred, however, because the stigmas may be completely fused into one with a capitate apex (as in Didymocarpus) or one of the two carpels or stigmas may be aborted resulting in a single stigma that may or may not be 2-lobed. Certain characters used in this treatment require some explanation. Disc shape is frequently described as \"ringlike,\" \"cupular,\" or rarely \"tubular\"; ringlike describes a disc that is shorter than or equalling its diameter, and cupular describes one that is longer than its diameter. Tubular describes a disc which is at least twice as long as wide. The corolla tube diameter measurement is for the widest part, usually the mouth. Wang Wentsai, Pan Kaiyu, & Li Zhenyu. 1990.

Tzvelev, believes that Lathraea should be placed near Tozzia Linnaeus of the Scrophulariaceae. The genus is tentatively placed here as a link with the Scrophulariaceae. Zhang Zhiyun. 1990.

However, a problem with the treatment of Berberis necessitated postponing publication of the family until the present volume. See the comments under Berberis, below.The family Berberidaceae presents an interesting, distinctive biogeography. The two species of Achlys Candolle are disjunctly distributed between E Asia and North America, with one in Japan and Korea and one along the west coast of North America. Caulophyllum and Diphylleia each contain three species; the former has one species in E Asia and two in North America, the latter has two in E Asia and one in North America. Sinopodophyllum and Plagiorhegma (if maintained separate from Podophyllum Linnaeus and Jeffersonia Barton, respectively) are endemic to E Asia, but their closest relatives, Podophyllum and Jeffersonia, are widely disjunct in E North America. Epimedium has a wide, fragmented range from Japan westward to Algeria; the nearest relative, Vancouveria C. Morren & Decaisne, is endemic to the Pacific Northwest of North America. Dysosma and Nandina are endemic to China, and Ranzania T. Ito is endemic to Japan.Podophyllum cavaleriei H. L\u00e9veill\u00e9 (Bull. Acad. Int. G\u00e9ogr.

      "Two of us (Lammers and Klein) do not agree with the separation of Leptocodon and Campanumoea from Codonopsis in this treatment. We consider that the single character used in each case, five lamellar glands alternate with the stamens in Leptocodon and baccate fruit in Campanumoea, is not sufficient to justify recognition of a distinct genus. We regard these two genera as embedded within Codonopsis, as was done by Lammers (in C. I. Peng, Phytogeogr. Bot. Invent. Taiwan, 43-61. 1992), Morris and Lammers (Bot. Bull. Acad. Sin. 38: 277-284. 1997), Lammers (in T. C. Huang, Fl. Taiwan, ed. 2, 4: 775-802. 1998), Lammers (in Kubitzki [Kadereit & Jeffrey], Fam. Gen. Vasc. Pl. 8: 26-56. 2007), and Lammers (World Checkl. Bibliogr. Campanulaceae. 262-273. 2007). On the other hand, one of us (Hong) notes that two characters distinguish Leptocodon from Codonopsis. One is the five lamellar glands and the other is the shape of the stigma segments, which are clavate in Leptocodon but orbicular-deltoid in Codonopsis. Campanumoea differs from Codonopsis not only in having baccate fruit but also in its pollen, which is shortly 5-colpate (vs. 5-8-long-colpate in the core group of Codonopsis). Campanumoea is not a very distinct genus, and it seems that it would be equally reasonable to sink it into Codonopsis or to separate it. However, if it were sunk, then it would also be reasonable to sink Adenophora into Campanula because the former genus differs from the latter only in having a nectar disk around the style.Pentaphragma Wallich ex G. Don and Sphenoclea Gaertner were included in Campanulaceae in FRPS but are treated in this volume as Pentaphragmataceae and Sphenocleaceae, respectively.

      "This is one of the largest families of flowering plants and is represented nearly worldwide though it is most abundant in the tropical regions of both hemispheres. Important economic members of the family are coffee (Coffea), quinine (Cinchona), madder (Rubia), ipecac (Carapichea Aublet), and various horticultural plants, notably Gardenia, Ixora, Mussaenda, and Pentas. Several genera include pantropical weeds, notably Mitracarpus, Richardia, and Spermacoce, of neotropical origin, and Oldenlandia (Hedyotis) of African origin. A number of species are used for various medicinal purposes.Genera, tribes, and subfamilies of Rubiaceae characteristically either have or lack raphides; this character is generally considered informative taxonomically in this family. Raphides are tiny, needle-shaped crystals that are produced in groups inside some cells of leaf, stem, flower, and fruit tissues. They apparently function to protect the plant from herbivores. Raphides are often visible with a hand lens on dried specimens, particularly in soft tissues such as petals, the calyx hypanthium, and the young leaves at the apex of the stem, but may be difficult to see especially in succulent plants.Leaf domatia are common in Rubiaceae and are sometimes taxonomically informative at least for separation of species. These domatia provide protection for tiny mites that live on the leaves and that help protect the plant from herbivores and fungi by eating insect eggs, small insects, and spores. These domatia occasionally take the form of foveolae or crypts, but more often are formed by small groups or tufts of pubescence, which is sometimes different in form from pubescence found on other parts of the plant.At least half of the species of Rubiaceae have distylous flowers: an individual species has two flower forms, the long-styled form (or pin) with the stigmas borne above the anthers and the short-styled form (or thrum) with the anthers borne above the stigmas. An individual plant bears only one flower form, and the flowers are incompatible with other flowers of similar form whether borne on the same or another plant. Heterostyly is unusual in the flowering plants and is found in several other plant families that mostly have three floral forms instead of two with the third form (the homostylous) with the stigmas and anthers borne at the same level. Tristyly has only been documented very rarely for Rubiaceae, although it was noted by FRPS for Chassalia curviflora in China.A number of species of many genera of Rubiaceae have calyx lobes that are unequal in size on an individual flower, and in some species of several genera one or more of the calyx lobes are markedly different, much enlarged and also often petaloid. These structures are found on flowers, where they are typically brightly colored and apparently function to attract pollinators, and\/or on the fruit, where they are dry and brown and apparently function in dispersal of the fruit or seeds. These structures have variously been called \"petaloid calyx lobes,\" a morphologically descriptive term; \"semaphylls,\" a term that refers to the assumed function in pollination; and \"calycophylls,\" the term used here that refers to the leaflike shape of the calyx lobe. These structures are sometimes mistaken for bracts; a few species of Rubiaceae do also have petaloid bracts (e.g., Dunnia), but those structures are inserted on the inflorescence axes or immediately below the ovary of the flower.The woody Rubiaceae are better represented (i.e., more diverse) in moist temperate regions of China than in comparable habitats in North America, as detailed by Latham and Ricklefs (in Ricklefs & Schluter, Spec. Diversity Ecol. Communities, 294-314. 1993). They concluded that this pattern, which is also found in a number of other dicotyledonous families, is due largely to historical factors. The principal factors they identified are the extinction of woody Rubiaceae in these other regions, while the plants were able to persist in E Asia (e.g., Emmenopterys), and the long-term direct connection of the moist temperate and moist tropical zones in E Asia vs. the separation of these zones by deserts and large water bodies in other regions. They agreed with Wolfe (in Nelson & Rosen, Vicariance Biogeogr. 413-427. 1981) that the connections of plant ranges between E North America and E Asia were broken by the end of the Eocene, and thus that species of the several genera that are found in both regions (e.g., Cephalanthus) have had separate evolutionary histories for some time. Several SE Asian Rubiaceae genera, all found in China, appear to represent the most basal living lineages of the family, notably Acranthera, Coptosapelta, and Luculia (Bremer et al., Syst. Biol. 48: 413-435. 1999; Bremer & Manen, Pl. Syst. Evol. 225: 43-72. 2000; Rydin et al., Pl. Syst. Evol. 278: 101-123. 2009).A number of species of Rubiaceae are cultivated as ornamentals; most of these are mentioned and some are keyed and described here.Additional information on many of the cultivated Rubiaceae was presented by Puff and Chamchumroon (Thai Forest Bull., Bot. 31: 75-94. 2003).Complete Rubiaceae floras for E Asia are very few. The Chinese Rubiaceae were treated comprehensively in 1999 by FRPS; the treatment here is based primarily on that work. The Fl. URSS was published in English in 2000, but this is an unedited, unmodified translation of the 1958 work. The Fl. Japan has been published in several editions but includes relatively few genera and is rather idiosyncratic. The genus overview within the Rubiaceae of Thailand: A Pictorial Guide to Indigenous and Cultivated Genera by Puff et al. (43-240. 2005) is a useful recent reference.Some morphological features that are characteristic of the Rubiaceae have been described, measured, and named very differently by different authors, and the differing terminology has generated some confusion. In particular, the terminology and measurements used for the calyx and gynoecium have differed widely. The ovary of Rubiaceae flowers is typically inferior, and the calyx is gamosepalous with its free portion, or limb, arising from the top of the ovary portion; this limb varies from reduced (i.e., not developed) to developed, and truncate to deeply lobed. Most Rubiaceae authors have distinguished the inferior ovary portion of the flower from the free calyx limb; the ovary portion has sometimes been called simply an ovary, but sometimes considered to include the fused calyx and corolla tissue covering it and called a hypanthium. However, several authors, including in FRPS, have treated as one structure the inferior ovary together with the unlobed lower portion of the calyx limb, when this is present, as the \"calyx tube\" and the lobed portion of the calyx as a separate structure, the calyx lobes. The \"calyx tube\" is often clearly delimited and measurable, but the inclusion of the ovary in this means that this measurement can sometimes include ovaries that have been fertilized and are developing into fruit, thus are larger than and not comparable to the ovaries at anthesis even though the corolla may be still attached to the flowers. Here the ovary or hypanthium portion of the flower is measured separately from the limb; the term \"hypanthium\" is used to link these measurements to those of FRPS. The limb is measured separately here because the length of the tubular portion of this often includes taxonomically useful information, and while the \"calyx tube\" measurement is lost when the fruit are developed, the length of the tubular portion of the free calyx limb is usually still evident on the fruit thus facilitating identification. Another portion of the gynoecium that has been regarded differently by different authors is the distinction between the stigma and style: the structures regarded as 2-lobed stigmas by some authors are regarded as a style with 2 separate stigmas by as many other authors. Morphological study of the androecium and gynoecium here during preparation of a flora treatment has not been detailed and no focused effort has been made here to systematize these morphological interpretations.Inflorescence terminology is complicated in most flowering plant families. The terms \"bract\" and \"bracteole\" have been carefully and regularly applied by some Rubiaceae authors, with the term \"bracteole\" used only for the bracts that immediately subtend the flowers or in some cases that are found anywhere along the pedicels, and the term \"bract\" used for the remaining structures. However, other authors have not distinguished these structures, or have not distinguished them regularly or consistently. The term \"floral bract\" here refers to the structures found on the pedicels or that immediately subtend sessile flowers. Bracts and leaves are generally considered homologous structures, and in Rubiaceae these often vary continuously along the inflorescences. In particular, Rubiaceae commonly have somewhat reduced leaves subtending the inflorescences, and bracts that are somewhat enlarged and occasionally leaflike. These structures have been variously called \"reduced leaves\" or \"foliose bracts\" or \"foliaceous bracts\" (here called \"leaflike bracts\"). In particular, many species with branched inflorescences sometimes have rather large, leaflike bracts subtending the basalmost pair of secondary axes; these have been various interpreted as enlarged bracts at the top of the peduncle, or vegetative leaves that are borne at the base of a sessile, tripartite inflorescence.Significant measurements found on plants from outside China are noted in the discussions following the species descriptions and\/or are included within brackets in the descriptions in accordance with Flora of China style. Authors in FRPS described the seeds and embryos of some Rubiaceae but not others; their descriptions are reported. In many cases no information is available about these features for Chinese Rubiaceae. Authors in FRPS also described the pollen of a few genera; these reports are not included here because a number of very detailed, extensively documented pollen descriptions are available elsewhere, which show that much variation is found in pollen morphology at the species level in Rubiaceae and as yet Rubiaceae genera are not well characterized in terms of pollen. Thus, the very limited information available only at the genus level here does not seem well integrated into this flora treatment. The counts presented here for leaf veins apply to the secondary veins, as done by the majority of Rubiaceae authors. Many species of Rubiaceae also frequently have rather well-developed though shorter intersecondary veins, which often vary widely in number and degree of development between populations or plants; these apparently were occasionally combined with the secondary veins in the measurements given by FRPS, but such measurements are subject to significant misinterpretation by authors working in other regions and the varied usage in that work adds yet more confusion.Where data were missing from the descriptions in the first draft for the Flora of China, the terms \"unknown,\" \"not known,\" \"not noted,\" and \"not seen\" were retained (with \"not known\" consisted to \"unknown\"). Where these terms were used in the habitats and elevational ranges they were deleted in accordance with the style of previous Flora of China volumes. Where missing data were denoted with question marks, e.g., \"shape??,\" or with constructions such as \"__ \u00d7 __ ,\" these were deleted because it was not apparent which of the above categories of missing data applied.The genus Khasiaclunea Ridsdale (Blumea 24: 347. 1979) is known with certainty from India and Myanmar and provisionally from N Vietnam; this may also be present in China, but no confidently determined specimens have yet been seen. The single species, K. oligocephala (Haviland) Ridsdale (Blumea 24: 347. 1979; Adina oligocephala Haviland, J. Linn. Soc., Bot. 33: 46. 1897), was reported by Ridsdale (loc. cit.) as \"probably\" found in China; however, this genus is not treated here.Lo Hsienshui, Ko Wancheung, Chen Weichiu, Hsue Hsianghao & Wu Hen. 1999.

However, several authors, including in FRPS, have treated as one structure the inferior ovary together with the unlobed lower portion of the calyx limb, when this is present, as the \"calyx tube\" and the lobed portion of the calyx as a separate structure, the calyx lobes. The \"calyx tube\" is often clearly delimited and measurable, but the inclusion of the ovary in this means that this measurement can sometimes include ovaries that have been fertilized and are developing into fruit, thus are larger than and not comparable to the ovaries at anthesis even though the corolla may be still attached to the flowers. Here the ovary or hypanthium portion of the flower is measured separately from the limb; the term \"hypanthium\" is used to link these measurements to those of FRPS. The limb is measured separately here because the length of the tubular portion of this often includes taxonomically useful information, and while the \"calyx tube\" measurement is lost when the fruit are developed, the length of the tubular portion of the free calyx limb is usually still evident on the fruit thus facilitating identification. Another portion of the gynoecium that has been regarded differently by different authors is the distinction between the stigma and style the structures regarded as 2-lobed stigmas by some authors are regarded as a style with 2 separate stigmas by as many other authors. Morphological study of the androecium and gynoecium here during preparation of a flora treatment has not been detailed and no focused effort has been made here to systematize these morphological interpretations.Inflorescence terminology is complicated in most flowering plant families. The terms \"bract\" and \"bracteole\" have been carefully and regularly applied by some Rubiaceae authors, with the term \"bracteole\" used only for the bracts that immediately subtend the flowers or in some cases that are found anywhere along the pedicels, and the term \"bract\" used for the remaining structures. However, other authors have not distinguished these structures, or have not distinguished them regularly or consistently. The term \"floral bract\" here refers to the structures found on the pedicels or that immediately subtend sessile flowers. Bracts and leaves are generally considered homologous structures, and in Rubiaceae these often vary continuously along the inflorescences. In particular, Rubiaceae commonly have somewhat reduced leaves subtending the inflorescences, and bracts that are somewhat enlarged and occasionally leaflike. These structures have been variously called \"reduced leaves\" or \"foliose bracts\" or \"foliaceous bracts\" (here called \"leaflike bracts\"). In particular, many species with branched inflorescences sometimes have rather large, leaflike bracts subtending the basalmost pair of secondary axes; these have been various interpreted as enlarged bracts at the top of the peduncle, or vegetative leaves that are borne at the base of a sessile, tripartite inflorescence.Significant measurements found on plants from outside China are noted in the discussions following the species descriptions and\/or are included within brackets in the descriptions in accordance with Flora of China style.  in FRPS described the seeds and embryos of some Rubiaceae but not others; their descriptions are reported. In many cases no information is available about these features for Chinese Rubiaceae.  in FRPS also described the pollen of a few genera; these reports are not included here because a number of very detailed, extensively documented pollen descriptions are available elsewhere, which show that much variation is found in pollen morphology at the species level in Rubiaceae and as yet Rubiaceae genera are not well characterized in terms of pollen. Thus, the very limited information available only at the genus level here does not seem well integrated into this flora treatment. The counts presented here for leaf veins apply to the secondary veins, as done by the majority of Rubiaceae authors. Many species of Rubiaceae also frequently have rather well-developed though shorter intersecondary veins, which often vary widely in number and degree of development between populations or plants; these apparently were occasionally combined with the secondary veins in the measurements given by FRPS, but such measurements are subject to significant misinterpretation by authors working in other regions and the varied usage in that work adds yet more confusion.Where data were missing from the descriptions in the first draft for the Flora of China, the terms \"unknown,\" \"not known,\" \"not noted,\" and \"not seen\" were retained (with \"not known\" consisted to \"unknown\"). Where these terms were used in the habitats and elevational ranges they were deleted in accordance with the style of previous Flora of China volumes. Where missing data were denoted with question marks, e.g., \"shape??,\" or with constructions such as \"__ \u00d7 __ ,\" these were deleted because it was not apparent which of the above categories of missing data applied.The genus Khasiaclunea Ridsdale (Blumea 24 347. 1979) is known with certainty from India and Myanmar and provisionally from N Vietnam; this may also be present in China, but no confidently determined specimens have yet been seen. The single species, K. oligocephala (Haviland) Ridsdale (Blumea 24 347. 1979; Adina oligocephala Haviland, J. Linn. Soc., Bot. 33 46. 1897), was reported by Ridsdale (loc. cit.) as \"probably\" found in China; however, this genus is not treated here.Lo Hsienshui, Ko Wancheung, Chen Weichiu, Hsue Hsianghao & Wu Hen. 1999.

      "Taxonomic discussion on the Asteraceae is included under the relevant tribes. The following notes apply to the whole family. Modes of reproduction in the Chinese Asteraceae are known only fragmentarily. As regards the world diversity of the family, only about 12% of genera have been studied using cytoembryology to identify the reproduction system. In 3%, agamospermy was found to occur. Probably the most common reproduction system is allogamy with a sporophytic self-incompatibility; occasional selfing is also possible (stigma ageing or mentor effect). More or less obligate autogamy is relatively rare. Other uncommon reproduction systems include gynodioecy, a very rare dioecy (with heterogametic females). Asexual reproduction is a widespread phenomenon in the Asteraceae, with a wide range of mechanisms. In addition to the rare adventitious embryony, there are common types of autonomous apomixis, agamospermy (apospory, diplospory) associated with various forms of embryogenesis (parthenogenesis, apogamety). All the types of reproduction are to be considered in the evaluation of population variation and for taxonomic conclusions because the prevailing type of reproduction substantially influences the variation limits of taxa.Ling Yong, Chen Yi-ling, Shih Chu, Chen Feng-hwai, Chang Chao-chien, Tseng Yong-qian, Hu Chi-ming & Huang Xiu-lan. 1979.

      "Grasses are present throughout China, but the largest area of natural grassland lies in the northern part of the country, forming part of the temperate Eurasian steppe. Much of this area has now been converted from rangeland into farmland with wheat (Triticum) as the major food crop. The moister grasslands of northeast China support forest steppe, the dominant natural grasses being Leymus chinensis and Stipa grandis. The climate becomes progressively drier eastward, supporting steppe and semidesert steppe. Species of Stipa are dominant, with Agropyron, Cleistogenes, Koeleria, and Leymus. Common grasses of the dry alpine steppe of the high Xizang-Qinghai Plateau include species of Elymus, Festuca, Leymus, Poa, Puccinellia, and Stipa. Desert grasses of northwest China include sand-binding species of Aeluropus, Cleistogenes, and Orinus.\r",

Extensive pure stands of Phacelurus latifolius are found in coastal salt marshes, as are introduced species of Spartina. Phragmites species form large colonies in the shallow margins of inland lakes and rivers.\r",
      "The subfamilies of Poaceae are not included here, as they are largely based on non-morphological characters that are not readily available for identification purposes. However, the traditional grass tribes, as broadly accepted over the last two decades, do mainly have a morphological expression, backed up by characteristics of anatomy, embryology, and other cryptic characters. With practice and increasing familiarity with the family, it is usually possible to assign an unknown grass to a tribe without undue difficulty. The tribe is therefore taken as the primary division here.\r",
      "Modern molecular systematic studies are providing new insights into grass relationships. This new information has been incorporated where it has proved possible to link it to morphology, mainly by the separation of Danthonieae from Arundineae and the repositioning of a few individual genera. However, where the new information leads to the redefinition of tribes, or the genera within them, on grounds not easily expressed morphologically, the traditional treatment has been retained. Aveneae are upheld as distinct from Poeae, and Eragrostideae as distinct from Cynodonteae, because they are usually easily recognizable and hence useful for identification. Grass taxonomy is at present undergoing a period of rapid modification. The incorporation of molecular data into the classification scheme is incomplete, alterations are ongoing, and a new system with overall acceptance has not yet emerged. The primary purpose of a Flora is to provide an identification guide, usually for the non-specialist, and it must therefore be based mainly on morphology. Those interested in the latest research and new ideas on grass relationships can find more detailed information in the taxonomic literature. The following is recommended: Columbus, J.

Underground stems absent, or present and then rhizomatous or tuberous; aerial stems variously produced or not, often evergreen; bulbils for vegetative reproduction sometimes produced, e.g., on leaf or on special shoots. Leaves alternate or apparently basal, usually petiolate with sheathing bases, often subtended by prophylls and\/or cataphylls; leaf blade various, e.g., linear, simple (base often cordate to sagittate), sometimes peltate or variously compound (e.g., pinnate, radiate, pedate, or decompound), or still more complex and \"dracontioid\" (elaborate forms of sagittate, hastate, or trisect leaves in which anterior and posterior divisions are highly dissected and subdivided). Inflorescences (sometimes precocious) subtended by membranous prophylls and\/or cataphylls, consisting of a spadix subtended by a spathe. Spathe commonly with tubelike base (margins fused or not) persistent or with deciduous blade.

      "One hundred and six genera and ca. 5,400 species: worldwide except Antarctica; 33 genera and 865 species (326 endemic, five introduced) in China.",
      "Recent phylogenetic studies (e.g., D. A. Simpson et al., Aliso 23: 72-83. 2007; A. M. Muasya et al., Bot. Rev. (Lancaster) 75: 52-66. 2009) suggest that tribal and generic delimitation in Cyperaceae is likely to be modified in the future.The closest relatives to Cyperaceae are Juncaceae and Thurniaceae (D. A. Simpson in P. Rudall, P. J. Cribb, D. F. Cutler & C. J. Humphries, eds., Monocot. Syst. Evol. 2: 497-509. 1995) in the order Poales. Poaceae, which shares some characteristics of Cyperaceae, such as wind pollination and reduced floral structure, has often been placed near to Cyperaceae but is now shown to be more distantly related (H. P. Linder & E. A. Kellogg in P. Rudall et al., loc. cit.: 473-496; D. A. Simpson in P. Rudall et al., loc. cit.: 497-509).Inflorescence structure in Cyperaceae is notoriously difficult to interpret due to its highly reduced nature. Consequently, the terminology used in describing parts of the inflorescence can be confusing with several terms often being applied to the same structure. In addition, several terms are also used in the Poaceae, but they do not always relate to the same structure in both families. A laudable attempt to standardize terminology in Cyperaceae was made by I. Kukkonen (Ann. Bot. Fenn. 31: 37-43. 1994). In our treatment we have attempted to keep terminology as simple as possible.Inflorescences are generally either unbranched or very shortly branched and spicate or capitate in appearance to prominently branched and paniculate or anthelate (umbel-like), with variations around these. The basic unit of the inflorescence in most Cyperaceae is the spikelet. This comprises a very short to elongated axis, which subtends one to many scalelike bracts, referred to here as glumes. Each glume subtends and partially hides a single very small, bisexual or unisexual flower, which may or may not have a perianth. The perianth, when present, is reduced to bristles or scales. There may be 1-3 stamens and a pistil comprising an ovary, style, and 2 or 3 stigmas. The ovary gives rise to a hard, 1-seeded nutlet (sometimes referred to as an achene). Spikelets tend to be aggregated into larger structures known as spikes. In the tribe Cariceae this basic structure is modified such that the spikelet is reduced to a single flower that is enclosed by a saclike structure known as a utricle, the latter being a modified prophyll at the base of the spikelet. The utricle is subtended by a glumelike bract, and the whole structure is again aggregated with others into spikes. Some confusion arises with caricoid spikes especially as the spikelets comprise only one flower and are subtended by a glumelike bract. This has meant that spikes are sometimes referred to as spikelets and the glumelike bracts as true glumes.The spikelet is indeterminate, i.e., having no terminal flower. However, in Hypolytrum, Lepironia, and Mapania, the basic inflorescence unit has an apparently terminal female flower. To distinguish this type of unit, the term pseudospikelet is used here; some authors refer to it as a spicoid. Its structure is rather different to that of the spikelet, comprising 2-12 scalelike floral bracts on a very much reduced axis. The two lowest bracts are opposite, keeled, and often enclose the upper bracts (when the latter are present). The lower bracts subtend a male flower comprising a single stamen, the upper bracts usually being empty. The terminal flower, which is not subtended by a floral bract, is female. There are no perianth bristles or scales, and the whole structure is subtended and partially to fully hidden by a glumelike bract. These are again aggregated into spikes, but there is further confusion in terminology with the spikes sometimes being referred to as spikelets. The above interpretation of the pseudospikelet is widely accepted, although some workers have interpreted it as a single flower.One of us (Dai) believes that if Kyllinga and Pycreus are treated as separate genera from Cyperus, as they are in this treatment, then Juncellus and Mariscus should also be separated from Cyperus on account of their distinct morphological characters.Tang Tsin & Wang Fa-Tsuan. 1961. Cyperaceae (1). In: Tang Tsin & Wang Fa-Tsuan, eds., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 11: i-xv, 1-261; Liang Song-yun, Dai Lun-kai, Tang Yan-cheng & Li Pei-chun. 2000. Cyperaceae (2). In: Dai Lun-kai & Liang Song-yun, eds., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 12: i-xxii, 1-582.For accurate identification of Cyperaceae good fruiting material should be used wherever possible. Indeed this is essential in certain genera, such as Fimbristylis and Scleria. It is also important to have underground parts as these may be diagnostic for some species. Care is needed when counting the number of stigmas as these are easily broken off. Several should be observed from the same specimen. Care is also needed when counting the stamens. Anthers break off easily leaving the filaments partially hidden within the glumes. Always check that filaments are present. Also, care should be taken to distinguish perianth bristles from filaments as the number of perianth bristles may be useful in separating taxa. The bristles will usually have antrorse or retrorse hairs on them.\r",

      "In the opinion of the present authors, it is too early to decide if the Lemnaceae should be included within the Araceae. While this placement has been supported by some phylogenetic studies, only a few species of Lemnaceae have been investigated so far. Before the whole spectrum of variability of molecular characteristics of the Lemnaceae is known, it would be unwise to change the status. The Lemnaceae are a well-characterized entity of taxa, whereas the Araceae are a heterogeneous group. It is very difficult to find common characters in the Lemnaceae and Araceae. The flowering organ is not at all decisive. It is not even certain if the flowering organ of the Lemnaceae is a flower or a reduced inflorescence. It is also very difficult to find special common characters between Lemnaceae and the genera that are placed nearest to them according to phylogenetic studies.Different species of Lemnaceae are often found sympatric at the same habitats; sometimes they are associated with various kinds of aquatic ferns and vascular plants. They usually grow gregariously and with rapid reproduction (up to doubling within 24 hours). The fronds of all species are commonly utilized as high-quality feed for domestic animals, fish, and fowl.Li Hen. 1979. Lemnaceae. In: Wu Cheng yih & Li Hen, eds., Fl. Reipubl.

      "Recent analyses of orchids incorporating data from DNA analyses have confirmed many aspects of the established classifications but have also provided some surprises for orchid taxonomists. First of all, the results have upheld the monophyly (evolutionary integrity, i.e., the group includes all the taxa derived from an ancestral species) of the orchid family, including the apostasioids and cypripedioids. They also suggest strongly that the orchids are an ancient group that evolved in the great southern continent of Gondwanaland before it split up to form the southern continents of Australia, Africa, and South America, the island of Madagascar, and the subcontinent of India. The subfamilies Apostasioideae, Cypripedioideae, and Orchidoideae (sensu Dressler, Phylogeny Classific. Orchid Fam. 1993) are all monophyletic. However, recent work clearly shows that Vanilla and its relatives form a separate and ancient clade (an evolutionary lineage including all the taxa derived from a single ancestral one) that deserves recognition as the subfamily Vanilloideae, that the Spiranthoideae nest within a more broadly defined Orchidoideae, and that Vandoideae are a specialized clade within a more broadly defined Epidendroideae.A detailed new classification of the orchid family is currently being produced under the title Genera Orchidacearum, of which four of the six volumes have been published and a fifth is near completion (Pridgeon et al., Gen. Orchid. 1-4(1). 1999-2005). Even when this work is completed, such is the speed with which new information and techniques are being developed and published, it will almost certainly require revision. However, we now have the broad bones of a more robust and predictive classification of the family that will be more satisfactory than the presently widely used systems that are based mainly upon morphological characters.The classification of the family is currently the subject of some debate, particularly the circumscription and the placement of certain tribes, subtribes, and genera. The classification of Chase et al. (in Dixon et al., Orchid Conservation, 69-89. 2003), elaborated in Pridgeon et al. (loc. cit.), which is strongly supported by recent molecular, embryological, and morphological analyses, is followed here. They recognize five subfamilies: Apostasioideae, Cypripedioideae, Vanilloideae, Orchidoideae, and Epidendroideae.Lang Kaiyong, Chen Singchi, Luo Yibo & Zhu Guanghua. 1999. Orchidaceae (1).
