      "The Lauraceae are economically important as sources of medicine, timber, nutritious fruits (e.g., Persea americana), spices (e.g., Cinnamomum cassia, C. subavenium, Laurus nobilis), and perfumes. The fruits of Actinodaphne, Cinnamomum, Cryptocarya, Lindera, Litsea, and Syndiclis contain abundant oil and fat. Cinnamomum trees, such as Cinnamomum camphora, C. glanduliferum, and C. parthenoxylon, yield camphor and essential oil, which are used for making perfumes and medicines. The bark of C. cassia and the roots of Lindera aggregata are famous traditional Chinese medicines.The Chinese species of Lauraceae remain poorly known and difficult to identify. The main reason for this is that for a substantial number of species the fruits or flowers are not known. This makes generic placement of such species uncertain, since most genera are defined by floral characters. A second problem is that characters of both flowers and fruits are used in most generic keys and since specimens almost never bear both flowers and fruits, identification is often almost impossible. A drastic remedy for this problem would be to make keys based on flowering specimens and list species known only with fruits as incompletely known species and not include them in the keys. This approach has not been followed in this treatment.The genera are here maintained as they have been recognized in earlier works on Chinese Lauraceae. The present authors are aware that this will seem inconsistent; for instance, in the case of Sassafras, species with 2-celled and 4-celled anthers are included in the same genus, while in other cases pairs of genera are separated based on this character (for example Lindera-Litsea, Alseodaphne-Nothaphoebe, and Parasassafras-Sinosassafras). Generic boundaries in the Litsea group (Actinodaphne, Dodecadenia, Iteadaphne, Lindera, Litsea, Neolitsea, Parasassafras, and Sinosassafras) are not well defined, and generic concepts are likely to change after further research.Aside from these problems, there are a number of vegetative characters that are helpful in the identification process. They are listed below.Leaves opposite or subopposite: Beilschmiedia p.p., Caryodaphnopsis, Cinnamomum p.p.Leaves verticillate or clustered: Actinodaphne, Neolitsea; rarely in Lindera (L. megaphylla) and Litsea (L. verticillata); weakly clustered in Alseodaphne, Dehaasia, Machilus, Phoebe.Leaves triplinerved and alternate: Cinnamomum p.p., Cryptocarya p.p., Lindera p.p., Neocinnamomum.Leaves triplinerved and clustered: Neolitsea.Leaves triplinerved and opposite: Caryodaphnopsis, Cinnamomum p.p.Leaves lobed: Lindera p.p., Sassafras.Leaves with tufts of hairs in axils of lateral veins: Cinnamomum p.p.The three genera Machilus, Persea, and Phoebe cannot be identified adequately by floral characters; they have been separated traditionally on the fruit characters listed in the key.Li Hsi-wen et al. 1982. Lauraceae. In: Li Hsi-wen, ed., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 31: 1-463.One of the present authors (van der Werff) provides this alternative key to genera.

      "Several species in the Magnolioideae are grown for their dried flower buds, known as xinyi (\u8f9b\u5937), which are used medicinally. In addition, HOUPOEA officinalis (Magnolia officinalis) is extensively grown for its medicinal bark. All species in the family are ornamental, and many are grown in public and private gardens throughout much of China and in other parts of the world.One of the co-authors (Nooteboom) considers the Magnoliaceae to include two monogeneric subfamilies, with Magnolioideae containing the genus Magnolia and Liriodendroideae containing the genus Liriodendron. The reduction of the former genera of Magnolioideae to a single genus is based on DNA analysis (S. Kim et al., Amer. J. Bot. 88: 717-728. 2001; H. Azuma et al., J. Plant Res. 112: 291-306. 1999; H. Azuma et al., Proc. Int. Symp. Fam. Magnoliac. 1988, 219-227. 2000; H. Azuma et al., Amer. J. Bot. 88: 2275-2285. 2001; W. S. Judd et al., Pl. Syst. Phylogenet. Approach, 222-224. 1999) and morphology (R. B. Figlar, Proc. Int. Symp. Fam. Magnoliac. 1988, 14-25. 2000; R. B. Figlar & H. P. Nooteboom, Blumea 49: 87-100. 2004). In the present treatment, not only are previously recognized genera still included but additional new and\/or reinstated segregate genera of Magnolioideae are recognized.Nooteboom observes problems in the present treatment of segregate genera. An example of morphological similarity, which is strengthened by DNA results, is the similar fruit of Michelia species and Yulania (Magnolia) stellata. The present treatment distinguishes Michelia and Yulania on the basis of pseudoaxillary flowers in Michelia, but Y. stellata also has pseudoaxillary flowers. Furthermore, the emphasis given to fruit characters in order to separate genera is inconsistent, which renders the key to genera unworkable for specimens that lack fruit. Michelia (Magnolia) baillonii has fruit with connate carpels and is regarded as a Michelia species, although, even with fruit, it cannot be determined to Michelia and instead keys out as Talauma. The same character, fruit with connate carpels, is used to distinguish T. (Magnolia) hodgsonii from Lirianthe, even though, in the absence of fruit, it can hardly or not at all be distinguished from L. (Magnolia) henryi.The following checklist is provided for the benefit of those who prefer to recognize Magnolioideae to include only the genus Magnolia. All the names in Magnolioideae accepted in the present treatment (in italics) are cross-referenced to the corresponding names in Magnolia (in boldface), with the latter followed by full bibliographic references. Except for treating Magnolioideae as monogeneric, the taxonomy at the specific and infraspecific levels in this checklist differs from the following main text of this treatment only in that one co-author (Nooteboom) considers that Magnolia fordiana var. calcarea, M. fordiana var. forrestii, M. figo var. crassipes, and M. figo var. skinneriana should be recognized rather than be treated as species.",

      "Herbs annual, biennial, or perennial, sometimes subshrubs or shrubs, with a pungent, watery juice. Eglandular trichomes unicellular, simple, stalked or sessile, 2- to many forked, stellate, dendritic, or malpighiaceous (medifixed, bifid, appressed), rarely peltate and scalelike; glandular trichomes multicellular, with uniseriate or multiseriate stalk. Stems erect, ascending, or prostrate, sometimes absent. Leaves exstipulate, simple, entire or variously pinnately dissected, rarely trifoliolate or pinnately, palmately, or bipinnately compound; basal leaf rosette present or absent; cauline leaves almost always alternate, rarely opposite or whorled, petiolate or sessile, sometimes absent. Inflorescence bracteate or ebracteate racemes, corymbs, or panicles, sometimes flowers solitary on long pedicels originating from axils of rosette leaves. Flowers hypogynous, mostly actinomorphic. Sepals 4, in 2 decussate pairs, free or rarely united, not saccate or lateral (inner) pair saccate. Petals 4, alternate with sepals, arranged in the form of a cross (cruciform; hence the earlier family name Cruciferae), rarely rudimentary or absent. Stamens 6, in 2 whorls, tetradynamous (lateral (outer) pair shorter than median (inner) 2 pairs), rarely equal or in 3 pairs of unequal length, sometimes stamens 2 or 4, very rarely 8-24; filaments slender, winged, or appendaged, median pairs free or rarely united; anthers dithecal, dehiscing by longitudinal slits. Pollen grains 3-colpate, trinucleate. Nectar glands receptacular, highly diversified in number, shape, size, and disposition around base of filaments, always present opposite bases of lateral filaments, median glands present or absent. Pistil 2-carpelled; ovary superior, sessile or borne on a distinct gynophore, mostly 2-locular and with a false septum connecting 2 placentae; placentation parietal, rarely apical; ovules anatropous or campylotropous, bitegmic, 1 to many per locule. Fruit typically a 2-valved capsule, generally termed silique (siliqua) when length 3 \u00d7 or more than width, or silicle (silicula) when length less than 3 \u00d7 width, dehiscent or indehiscent, sometimes schizocarpic, nutletlike, lomentaceous, or samaroid, segmented or not, terete, angled, or flattened parallel to septum (latiseptate) or at a right angle to septum (angustiseptate); valves 2(or 3-6); replum (persistent placenta) rounded, rarely flattened or winged; septum complete, perforated, reduced to a rim, or lacking; style 1, distinct, obsolete, or absent; stigma capitate or conical, entire or 2-lobed, sometimes lobes decurrent and free or connate. Seeds without endosperm, uniseriately or biseriately arranged in each locule, aseriate when 1, winged or wingless, mucilaginous or not when wetted; cotyledons incumbent (embryo notorrhizal: radicle lying along back of 1 cotyledon), accumbent (embryo pleurorrhizal: radicle applied to margins of both cotyledons), or conduplicate (embryo orthoplocal: cotyledons folded longitudinally around radicle), rarely spirally coiled (embryo spirolobal). Germination epigeal.\r",
      "About 330 genera and 3500 species: all continents except Antarctica, mainly in temperate areas, with highest diversity in Irano-Turanian, Mediterranean, and W North American regions; 102 genera (eight endemic) and 412 species (115 endemic) in China.",
      "Because of lack of a comprehensive classification based on phylogenetic relationships among genera, and in order to facilitate direct comparison between the accounts in FOC and FRPS, the sequence of genera follows Schulz (Nat. Pflanzenfam. 17b: 227-658. 1936). However, it should be emphasized that his system is largely artificial because he placed closely related genera in different tribes and remotely related genera in the same tribe. For example, Arabis, Aubrieta, Draba, and Macropodium, which are very closely related on the basis of recent molecular studies, were placed by Schulz in four different tribes, whereas the unrelated Capsella, Lepidium, and Thlaspi were placed in one tribe. The delimitation of genera is often difficult, and mature fruits are needed for reliable identification.The Brassicaceae include many important crop plants that are grown as vegetables (Brassica, Nasturtium, Raphanus) and sources of vegetable oils (Brassica) and condiments (Armoracia, Brassica, Eutrema, Sinapis). Oils of Brassica probably rank first in terms of tonnage of the world's production of edible oils. The family includes many ornamentals in the genera Erysimum, Iberis Linnaeus, Lobularia, Malcolmia, and Matthiola. Of these, only Lobularia maritima has become naturalized in China. The family also includes more than 120 species of weeds. Arabidopsis thaliana, which is naturalized in China, has become the model organism in many fields of experimental biology.The delimitation of genera in the Brassicaceae is often difficult because of the frequent independent evolution of what appear to be similar character states, the variability of a given character in one genus and its fixture in another, and the inadequate sampling of material by most authors. Fruit characters are essential in the identification of genera. However, a key emphasizing flowering material is given in addition to the one emphasizing fruit. The most reliable determination of genera can be achieved when the material has both fruit and flowers and when both keys are successfully used to reach the same genus.The types of cotyledonary position, which in reality is the position of the radicle in relation to the cotyledons (e.g., radicle accumbent, incumbent, or conduplicate, though radicle referred to as \"cotyledon\" throughout) are important in the separation of many genera, and a cross section of the seed provides the easiest and simplest way of determining that position. The exact number of ovules per ovary can easily be determined from the fruit because aborted ovules persist through fruit dehiscence. However, it is more laborious to determine the ovule number from pistils and young fruit.Cheo Tai-yien, Guo Rong-lin, Lan Young-zhen, Lou Lian-li, Kuan Ke-chien & An Zheng-xi. 1987. Cruciferae.

      "During the past several years, cladistic analyses of morphological, chemical, and DNA data have made it clear that the recognition of the Saxifragaceae sensu lato (Engler, Nat. Pflanzenfam. 18a: 74-226. 1928) is untenable. Among the angiosperm families, Saxifragaceae sensu lato may in fact represent the most extreme example of a polyphyletic assemblage. For example, recent analyses of DNA sequence data indicate that these taxa represent at least ten separate evolutionary lines, many of which are only distantly related to one another (Morgan & Soltis, Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard. 80: 631-660. 1993; Soltis & Soltis, Amer. J. Bot. 84: 504-522. 1997). Furthermore, very large molecular phylogenetic analyses of hundreds of angiosperms indicate that these separate lineages are distributed among four of the six traditionally recognized subclasses of dicotyledons (Savolainen et al., Syst. Biol. 49: 306-362. 2000; Soltis et al., Nature 402: 402-404. 1999). These recent studies have also greatly clarified how this phylogenetically diverse assemblage should be divided into families and treated taxonomically (see The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG), Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard. 85: 531-553. 1998). Recent studies of DNA sequence data have clarified both the circumscription and affinities of a narrowly defined Saxifragaceae (Saxifragaceae sensu stricto) and Hydrangeaceae (Soltis et al., Amer. J. Bot. 82: 504-514. 1995; Savolainen et al., loc. cit.; Soltis et al., loc. cit. 1999). Saxifragaceae sensu stricto should consist only of Saxifragoideae, a group of about 30 herbaceous genera. Members of Saxifragaceae sensu stricto from the Chinese flora include Astilbe, Astilboides, Bergenia, Chrysosplenium, Mitella, Mukdenia, Oresitrophe, Rodgersia, Saxifraga, Tanakaea, Tiarella, and the recently described Saniculiphyllum. Close relatives of Saxifragaceae sensu stricto include Itea, Penthorum, and Ribes. These genera, the sole members of Iteoideae, Penthoroideae, and Ribesioideae, respectively, are also best treated in separate families: Iteaceae, Penthoraceae, and Grossulariaceae (see APG, loc. cit.). These taxa, as well as several others, such as Crassulaceae, are basal to a large assemblage of taxa, most of which were traditionally placed in Rosidae. Sequence data also indicate that Parnassia (the sole member of the Parnassioideae) is a more derived member of the rosid alliance, most closely related to Brexia and Lepuropetalon (also part of Saxifragaceae sensu lato) and Celastraceae. Parnassia and Lepuropetalon should be placed in Parnassiaceae with Brexia part of an expanded Celastraceae (APG, loc. cit.).Both morphological and molecular data indicate that Hydrangeoideae and Escallonioideae are, in contrast, allied with taxa traditionally placed in Asteridae. Hydrangeoideae are a well-defined, monophyletic lineage that should be treated as Hydrangeaceae. In China they include Cardiandra, Decumaria, Deinanthe, Deutzia, Dichroa, Hydrangea, Kirengeshoma, Philadelphus, Pileostegia, Platycrater, and Schizophragma, and are closely allied with families such as Cornaceae, Loasaceae, and Nyssaceae. Escallonioideae appear to be polyphyletic, and this group of approximately 14 genera is in need of thorough study. Members of this subfamily are allied with several different lineages of higher asterids. Polyosma, the only member of Escallonioideae in China, appears closely allied with Caprifoliaceae (Xiang & Soltis in Boufford & Ohba, Sino-Japanese Flora: its Characteristics and Diversification, 1998).Nevertheless, in the present account, the Saxifragaceae are retained in the sense of FRPS, using the same sequence of genera and indicating the subfamilies in the key below, in order to facilitate comparison with that flora.The genus Changiodendron R. H. Miao (Acta Sci. Nat. Univ. Sunyatseni 34: 65. 1995) and its single species, C. guangxiense R. H. Miao (loc. cit.: 66), was described from Guangxi (Napo Xian) and stated to belong to the Iteaceae (i.e., Iteoideae). However, Peng (Acta Bot. Yunnan. 18: 299-300. 1996) demonstrated that C. guangxiense is a synonym of Sabia parviflora Wallich (Sabiaceae).Pan Jin-tang. 1992. Saxifragaceae (1) [Penthoroideae, Saxifragoideae].

The molecular trees clearly show that they are both nested within the Anacardiaceae.

In China, the resinous sap of Toxicodendron vernicifluum and T. succedaneum is called Chinese lacquer. Rhus chinensis is the host plant of the aphid Melaphis chinensis that produces the \"Chinese gall,\" which in turn is a rich source of gallic acid. Anacardium occidentale and Mangifera indica are widely cultivated as fruit trees, and Pistacia chinensis yields a natural yellow dye. Several plants have ornamental value, such as Cotinus coggygria var. cinerea, which produces spectacular red leaves in the autumn.The resinous sap of Anacardiaceae hardens and turns black when exposed to the air. Some species in the family, especially of Toxicodendron and Semecarpus, can cause severe dermatitis after contact, especially in persons who have been sensitized by long-term exposure to the plants.Ming Tien lu. 1980.

Comber in the Celastraceae (see p. 472).Ilex nokoensis Hayata (J. Coll. Sci. Imp. Univ. Tokyo 30(1): 56. 1911) is the basionym of Symplocos nokoensis (Hayata) Kanehira in the Symplocaceae (see Fl. China 15: 244. 1996).Ilex racemosa Oliver is the basionym of Perrottetia racemosa (Oliver) Loesener in the Dipentodontaceae (see p. 495).Ilex rarasanensis Sasaki (Trans. Nat. Hist. Soc. Formosa 21: 154. 1931), described from Taiwan, could not be treated here because we did not see the type material."

Leaves alternate or opposite, rarely whorled; stipules usually present, often free, sometimes modified into spines or glands, deciduous or persistent; petioles long to short, sometimes with glands at apex or base; leaf blade simple, sometimes palmately lobed, rarely compound, or reduced to scales, margins entire or toothed, sometimes with distinct glands along margin and\/or on surface, venation pinnate or palmate. Inflorescences axillary or terminal, flowers in cymes or fascicles, these often arranged along an elongated axis, branched or unbranched, forming a thyrse, in congested heads, or in a flowerlike cyathium with very reduced flowers enclosed within a \u00b1 cupular involucre; bracts sometimes petaloid. Flowers unisexual, within same inflorescence or in separate inflorescences, actinomorphic. Sepals (1-)3-6(-8), free or connate into calyx tube, valvate or imbricate, rarely absent (Euphorbia). Petals free, often reduced or absent. Disk present or absent. Male flowers with disk intrastaminal or extrastaminal, entire to dissected. Stamens one to very many, hypogynous; filaments free or connate; anthers 2(-4)-locular, mostly dehiscing longitudinally, rarely transversely or by pores, introrse or extrorse; rudimentary ovary sometimes present. Female flowers rarely with staminodes; ovary superior, (1-)2-5(-20)-locular; placentation axile; ovules 1 or 2 per locule, anatropous or hemitropous; styles free or connate, entire or lobed, or multifid, lobes erect, horizontal or curved; stigma capitate, linear, fimbriate, fan-shaped or pinnatilobate. Fruit typically a capsule elastically dehiscent into 2-valved cocci from a persistent columella, sometimes a berry or drupe. Seeds 1 or 2 per locule; seed coat thin to indurate, sometimes fleshy to form a sarcotesta; caruncle sometimes present; aril sometimes present; endosperm present or absent; embryo straight to curved or folded; cotyledons usually broader than radical. x = 6-14.Trees, shrubs, or herbs, usually without latex (present in Bischofia); indumentum of simple hairs (branched in Phyllanthus reticulatus), often absent. Leaves alternate, often distichous, sometimes scalelike on main stems; petiole usually short, usually without glands (present in Aporosa); leaf blade simple, margin entire or minutely serrulate (long petioles, 3(-5)-foliolate with toothed margins in Bischofia); venation pinnate, rarely obscurely 3-veined from base. Inflorescences mostly axillary, without visible axis (present in Antidesma, Aporosa, Baccaurea, Bischofia, Richeriella). Male flowers with 2-8 stamens, anthers longitudinally dehiscent (variable in Phyllanthus); female flowers with 2 ovules per locule. Seeds without caruncle, sometimes with fleshy aril or fleshy testa.Trees to shrubs. Leaf blade leathery, grayish when dry, base often asymmetrical. Ovules 1 per locule; stigmas dilated, peltate or reniform. Fruit a relatively large 1-seeded drupe, usually crowned by persistent flaplike stigmas. Seeds without caruncle.Plants with or without latex; indumentum of simple, stellate, scalelike, stinging, or glandular hairs, sometimes absent. Leaves alternate or opposite; leaf blade simple or compound, sometimes deeply divided, margin entire or variously toothed, often with sessile glands near junction with petiole and\/or along margins; venation pinnate or palmate. Inflorescences basically thyrsoid, very variable, often with well-defined main axis and\/or distinct cymes, rarely a sessile axillary fascicle. Ovules 1 per locule of ovary. Seed sometimes carunculate, sometimes arillate.\r",
      "About 322 genera and 8910 species: widespread throughout the world, primarily in the tropics and subtropics, more poorly represented in temperate regions; 75 genera (one endemic, nine introduced) and 406 species (99 endemic, 27 introduced) in China, nearly 95% of which are found in the S and SW parts of the country.Fifty-nine genera and over 1700 species: mostly tropical, the greatest diversity in SE Asia; 16 genera and 138 species (41 endemic, four introduced) in China.Four genera and ca. 210 species: throughout the tropics; two genera and 13 species (three endemic) in China.Two hundred and eighteen genera and over 5700 species: widespread throughout the world, primarily in the tropics and subtropics, more poorly represented in temperate regions; 54 genera (one endemic, nine introduced) and 255 species (55 endemic, 23 introduced) in China.",
      "The Euphorbiaceae as treated here include the following families that have been proposed for segregation: Androstachydaceae, Antidesmataceae, Bischofiaceae, Hymenocardiaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Pedilanthaceae, Picrodendraceae, Porantheraceae, Putranjivaceae, Ricinocarpaceae, Scepaceae, Stilaginaceae, Trewiaceae, and Uapacaceae. The Pandaceae and Buxaceae, formerly included here, are now well established as separate families.Molecular data has shown that the traditional concept of Euphorbiaceae includes three major lineages that are relatively distantly related to each other: the Phyllanthoids (genera 1-16 in this account), the Putranjivoids (genera 17 and 18), and the Euphorbioids (genera 19-75).Many species of Euphorbiaceae are of economic importance, probably most importantly as the main source of rubber (Hevea) but also as sources of medicine; foods, both as a staple starch source (Manihot) and fruits (e.g., Phyllanthus emblica); seed oils (Ricinus, Vernicia); and insecticides.Li Pingt\u2019ao. 1994. Euphorbiaceae. In: Li Pingt\u2019ao, ed., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 44(1): ii-viii, 1-217; Kiu Huashing, Hwang Shumei & Chang Yongtian. 1996. Euphorbiaceae (2). In: Kiu Huashing, ed., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 44(2): ii-ix, 1-212; Ma Jinshuang & Tseng Yungchien. 1997. Euphorbiaceae (3). In: Ma Jinshuang, ed., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 44(3): ii-vi, 1-150.The Putranjivoid genera resemble phyllanthoids by their 2-ranked leaves, frequently rather small fasciculate flowers, and ovules 2 per locule. They can be distinguished by their leaf blades, stigmas, and fruit. Also, the leaves contain mustard oils and so frequently taste peppery when fresh, although the taste may take a little time to develop.",
      "Ovules 1 per locule; indumentum of simple, stellate, scalelike, glandular, or stinging hairs; latex present or absent; leaves mostly spiral, less often distichous, blade sometimes lobed (palmately compound in Hevea), margin entire or variously toothed, often with glands\/extra-floral nectaries on petiole apex\/leaf base and\/or margins; inflorescence axillary or terminal, often thyrsoid or cymose, sometimes pseudanthial, rarely sessile clusters; seeds sometimes carunculate. .....

      "Baas et al. (Grana 18: 69-89. 1979) provided two interpretations of the perianth, one similar to the above (although with petals (3 or)4(or 5)) and another in which the inner whorl is regarded as a calyx, the outer whorl as bracteoles or an epicalyx, and the corolla consequently absent.In their detailed review, Baas et al. (loc. cit.) were unable to place Plagiopteron with any confidence and concluded that the genus deserved family rank, following Airy Shaw\u2019s earlier concept (Kew Bull. 18: 249-273. 1965). The molecular evidence presented in abstract by Simmons et al. (Amer. J. Bot. 87(6, Abstracts): 156-157. 2000) placed Plagiopteron clearly in the Celastraceae, close to the Hippocrateoid genera. Savolainen et al. (Kew Bull. 55: 257-306. 2000) and Soltis et al. (Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 133: 381-461. 2000) similarly placed the genus. The general appearance of the plant, a woody climber with fairly large opposite leaves, small flowers in many-flowered terminal cymes, and fruit with Acer-like wings supports this affinity. Further similarities were found in the elastic material of the leaf midrib vascular cylinder. The pollen of Plagiopteron is apparently unusual for Celastraceae (Baas et al., loc. cit.).Chang Hung-ta. 1989. Plagiopteron. In: Chang Hung-ta, ed., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 49(1): 48-50."

      "Oil glands of Rutaceae, when viewed from the surface of plant parts they occupy, are usually pellucid. They also appear to be \u00b1 isodiametric and to have \u00b1 definite patterns of distribution. In blades of leaves, for example, where they are most commonly observed, they are usually \u00b1 evenly scattered throughout, or sometimes they are restricted to the margins. Rarely they are alleged to occur only along the secondary veins of the blades.In a cladistic analysis of selected genera of Rutaceae and related families based on rbcL and atpB molecular data (but only on rbcL data for Harrisonia), M. W. Chase, C. M. Morton, and J. A. Kallunki (Amer. J. Bot. 86: 1191-1199. 1999) recommended the placement of Harrisonia (traditionally Simaroubaceae) in Rutaceae. We do not agree with this classification, particularly because Harrisonia appears to lack oil glands, and suggest that the genus is most correctly placed in Cneoraceae, in which it is treated herein.Several taxa of cultivated Rutaceae treated by C. C. Huang (Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 43(3). 1997) are not treated here: Casimiroa edulis La Llave, which is native to Mexico, has been introduced as a cultivated plant to the Xishuangbanna Botanical Garden in Yunnan; Limonia acidissima Linnaeus (Feronia limonia (Linnaeus) Swingle), which is native to India and Sri Lanka, has been reported as cultivated in Taiwan by C.
