      "Molecular studies have shown that the members of the Bombacaceae, Malvaceae, Sterculiaceae, and Tiliaceae form a very well-defined monophyletic group that is divided into ten also rather well-defined clades, only two of which correspond to the traditional families Bombacaceae and Malvaceae. Some of the remaining groups are included entirely within either of the remaining families but others cut across the traditional divide between the Sterculiaceae and Tiliaceae. A majority of authors, most notably Bayer and Kubitzki (Fam. Gen. Vasc. Pl. 5: 225-311. 2003), has favored including everything within a greatly enlarged Malvaceae, and treating the individual clades as subfamilies. The alternative view is that the individual clades should be treated as a series of ten families: Bombacaceae (Bombacoideae), Brownlowiaceae (Brownlowioideae), Byttneriaceae (Byttnerioideae), Durionaceae (Durionoideae), Helicteraceae (Helicteroideae), Malvaceae (Malvoideae), Pentapetaceae (Dombeyoideae), Sparrmanniaceae (Grewioideae), Sterculiaceae (Sterculioideae), and Tiliaceae (Tilioideae) (Cheek in Heywood et al., Fl. Pl. Fam. World. 201-202. 2007). For the present treatment, we prefer to retain the familiar, traditional four families, so as to maintain continuity with the treatments in FRPS, and to await a consensus on the two alternative strategies for dealing with the very widely accepted clades.The traditional Malvaceae coincides exactly with one of the major clades. The only possible problem is the relationship with the Bombacaceae, which also has primarily 1-loculed anthers, and some authorities have suggested that the Bombacaceae should be included within the Malvaceae.Members of the Malvaceae are important as fiber crops (particularly cotton, Gossypium). Young leaves of many species can be used as vegetables, and species of Abelmoschus and Hibiscus are grown as minor food crops. Many species have attractive flowers and an ever-increasing selection is grown as ornamentals. Several have been cultivated for a very long time, particularly species of Hibiscus, and some of these are not known in the wild.Feng Kuo-mei. 1984. Malvaceae. In: Feng Kuo-mei, ed., Fl. Reipubl.

      "Former classifications usually placed Rhamnaceae in the Rhamnales, together with Vitaceae and Leeaceae (Suessenguth in Engler & Prantl, Nat. Pflanzenfam., ed. 2, 20d. 1953), or together with Elaeagnaceae (Thorne, Bot. Rev. 58: 225-348. 1992). Orders such as Celastrales, Urticales, and Euphorbiales have often been considered as closely related groups. Recent analyses of DNA sequences strongly supported including the family in the Rosales, beside the closest relatives Barbeyaceae and Dirachmaceae (see Angiosperm Phylogeny Group II, Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 141: 399-436. 2003). Suessenguth (loc. cit.) grouped the family into five tribes, mainly characterized by fruit characters. Richardson et al. (Kew Bull. 55: 311-340. 2000; Amer. J. Bot. 87: 1309-1324. 2000) revised this tribal classification on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis using rbcL and trnL-F sequences of the plastid genome. Now 11 tribes are recognized, of which four are represented in the Flora area.Microrhamnus bodinieri H. L\u00e9veill\u00e9 (Fl.

China 13: 302. 2007).The bark, leaves, and fruit of several species of Rhamnus have been used as laxatives, notably R. cathartica and R. frangula. Diverse Old World species of Rhamnus provide yellow and green dyes as well as drugs. Timber of Alphitonia, Colubrina, Hovenia, and Ziziphus species is used for construction, fine furniture, carving, lathework, and musical instruments. Many Ziziphus species yield edible fruit; among them, Z. jujuba (Chinese jujube) and Z. mauritiana (Indian jujube) are cultivated on a commercial scale. Hovenia dulcis is also grown for its edible, fleshy inflorescence stalks. Species of Hovenia, Paliurus, and Rhamnus are cultivated as ornamentals.Chen Yi-ling & Chou Pan-kai. 1982. Rhamnaceae.

      "There is some variation in the circumscription of Sapindaceae in taxonomic treatments, particularly with regard to the inclusion of genera from the closely related, predominately temperate families Aceraceae and Hippocastanaceae. Several studies including M\u00fcller and Leenhouts (in Ferguson & M\u00fcller, Evolutionary Significance Exine: 407-445. 1976), and more recently those based on molecular data (Stevens, Angiosperm Phylogeny Website, 2001 onward; Harrington et al., Syst. Bot. 30: 366-382. 2005), supported the recognition of a broadly defined Sapindaceae incorporating Aceraceae and Hippocastanaceae. Harrington et al. (loc. cit.) proposed four subfamilies or clades, comprising Sapindoideae (including Koelreuteria and Ungnadia Endlicher), Dodonaeoideae, Hippocastanoideae (including taxa previously referred to Aceraceae and Hippocastanaceae, plus Handeliodendron), and a monotypic \"Xanthoceratoideae\". Within Hippocastanoideae, Acer Linnaeus and Dipteronia Oliver comprise a monophyletic group and are treated in this Flora as Aceraceae. Similarly, Aesculus Linnaeus, Billia Peyritsch, and the Chinese endemic Handeliodendron Rehder form a monophyletic group and are treated here as Hippocastanaceae. There is some support for \"Xanthoceratoideae\" being the first lineage to diverge within the broadly defined Sapindaceae assemblage; consequently, Xanthoceras is treated separately from genera in Sapindoideae and Dodonaeoideae in the following account of Sapindaceae s.s. The sequence of genera reflects M\u00fcller and Leenhouts (loc. cit.) as modified by recent analyses based on molecular and morphological data, rather than following the order developed by Radlkofer (Sitzungsber. Math.-Phys. Cl. K\u00f6nigl. Bayer. Akad. Wiss. M\u00fcnchen 20: 105-379. 1890; and in Engler, Pflanzenreich 98a-h(IV. 165): 1-1539. 1931-1934), which was previously followed in FRPS.The main economic uses of this family include (1) timber: Amesiodendron chinense, Dimocarpus longan, D. confinis, Litchi chinensis, Pavieasia kwangsiensis, and Pometia pinnata; (2) fruit: Dimocarpus longan, Litchi chinensis, and Nephelium lappaceum; (3) medicine: Dimocarpus longan (arillode), Litchi chinensis (seeds), and Sapindus saponaria (roots); (4) oil: Amesiodendron chinense, Delavaya toxocarpa, and Xanthoceras sorbifolium. Saponins occur widely in the family, commonly used as a fish poison and for their detergent properties.Lo Hsien-shui & Chen Te-chao. 1985. Sapindaceae (excluding Handeliodendron).

      "From the morphological standpoint, the Lythraceae sensu lato (including Trapaceae) have a very generalized morphology, without a single unique, defining character, i.e., there is no morphological synapomorphy that defines the family. At the same time, the genera are distinct. The position of the ovary in Duabanga, Punica, Sonneratia, and Trapa is variable: superior to partly inferior in Sonneratia; partly inferior in Duabanga; and partly, nearly, or completely inferior in Punica and Trapa. Several other features ally these genera to the Lythraceae sensu stricto, including opposite and simple leaves, commonly held wood anatomical characters (true for the Myrtales generally), development of a persistent floral tube, valvate sepals, 4- or 6-merous flowers, introrse and versatile anthers, axile placentation, and seeds without endosperm. Of the four genera, Trapa is the most divergent, but still sufficiently similar to the Lythraceae and Onagraceae to have been considered for membership within either family, or as a closely related family (as has been done in the present Flora). The inclusion of Sonneratia, Duabanga, and Punica in the Lythraceae adds some additional derived features to the definition of the family, but at the same time, brings together taxa that we know, from molecular sequence data, represent a single historical lineage. That knowledge of evolutionary relationship is lost if the genera are maintained as separate families, whereas the taxonomic utility of the Flora is not affected by their inclusion in an expanded Lythraceae.The molecular data from four genes (three chloroplast and one nuclear) unquestionably place not only Duabanga, Punica, and Sonneratia, but also Trapa, within the Lythraceae. Punica is well supported as a member of a clade of genera that includes Capuronia Lourteig, Galpinia N. E. Brown, and Pemphis (from East Africa and Madagascar). Duabanga and Lagerstroemia are sister genera, and Sonneratia and Trapa, as unlikely as it may seem morphologically, are also sister genera. Duabanga, Lagerstroemia, Sonneratia, and Trapa together form one of seven clades in the family.In addition to the species described below, several species have been recorded as introduced or cultivated in China. Cuphea carthagenensis (Jacquin) J. F. Macbride (C. balsamona Chamisso & Schlechtendal), of South American origin, is an introduced weed in many places in the Pacific, although it has never been cultivated. Cuphea viscosissima Jacquin (C. petiolata (Linnaeus) Koehne 1882, not Pohl ex Koehne 1877), native to the E United States, has never been cultivated but misidentifications of cultivated C. lanceolata in botanical gardens as C. viscosissima (or C. petiolata) have put its name in records of cultivated plants. Several other species have been recorded as cultivated in China, including C. hookeriana Walpers, C. hyssopifolia Kunth, C. ignea A. Candolle (C. platycentra Lemaire, 1846, not Bentham, 1839), C. lanceolata W. T. Aiton, C. micropetala Kunth, and C. procumbens Ortega, as well as Heimia myrtifolia Chamisso & Schlechtendal, Lafoensia vandelliana Chamisso & Schlechtendal, and Lawsonia inermis Linnaeus.

Datisca cannabina is a large, perennial, dioecious herb with pinnate leaves, and is distributed from the E Mediterranean (Crete) to the Himalayas, including countries adjoining W China from Kazakhstan to Nepal.

      "Although many members of this family have distinctive vegetative and floral features, providing a useful key to identify the many genera in China presents several difficulties. First, the classification of genera and generic groupings has been largely based on the morphology and anatomy of the fruit. Thus, to construct a \u201cgood\u201d dichotomous key with equal leads, rather than \u201cchipping off\u201d individual genera using unique characteristics, the use of fruit macro- and microscopic characters is unavoidable. This is even more acute when dealing with large numbers of genera. Another major problem is that several of the large genera are heterogeneous, with diffuse generic boundaries and broad patterns of variation. To try and cope with these difficulties two types of identification tool are presented here. The first is a dichotomous key that emphasizes the traditional fruit characters, and the second is a multi-access key that allows easy comparison of ten characteristics across all genera. The multi-access key is particularly useful for incomplete material, but it is worth stressing that specimens without at least developing fruit are usually very difficult to identify.\r",

      "The following dichotomous key reflects the traditional classification of the genera of the Apiaceae into subfamilies, tribes, and subtribes. This classification relies heavily on characters of fruit morphology and anatomy, many of which are subject to convergent evolution (e.g., for fruit dispersal strategies). The long-held understanding that this gives rise to artificial, heterogeneous assemblages has been verified by recent molecular studies of DNA sequences. For this reason tribes and subtribes are not formally recognized in the following account; however, they are indicated in the dichotomous key and the traditional order of genera is largely retained. It is worth noting that the generic grouping within the three subfamilies is well supported by molecular evidence, the exception being Hydrocotyle and Centella which are most likely derived, herbaceous members of the Araliaceae and not Hydrocotyloideae (the residue of this subfamily is restricted to the S hemisphere).",

      "The family is treated here in the strict sense, excluding Alangium (Alangiaceae), Aucuba (Aucubaceae), Davidia (Davidiaceae), Helwingia (Helwingiaceae), Mastixia (Mastixiaceae), Nyssa (Nyssaceae), and Toricellia (Toricelliaceae), all of which have sometimes been placed in the Cornaceae. The Cornaceae in the FRPS included Mastixia, Cornus sensu lato, Aucuba, Helwingia, and Toricellia. Given that the latter three genera are allied with higher asterids in broad phylogenetic analyses, they are, therefore, removed from the Cornaceae in this treatment. These genera are recognized in the present volume as three families following Takhtajan (Sist. Magnoliofit. 1987). Based on molecular data, Mastixia is a close relative, but not the sister of, Cornus. Its relationships to Cornus and close relatives remain unclear. Thus, we also treat Mastixia as a family separate from Cornaceae. Although molecular data have suggested that Alangium is a member of Cornaceae, the genus will be treated as a separate family in a different volume of the Flora of China. This treatment of Cornaceae therefore includes only Cornus sensu lato.\r",
      "The circumscription of the Cornaceae and the relationships among the 17 genera often placed within it have been controversial. The family has been defined as consisting of a single genus, Cornus, or up to as many as 15 genera by various authors (e.g., Harms, Ber. Deutsch. Bot. Ges. 15: 19\u201329. 1898; Takhtajan, Sist. Magnoliofit. 1987; Cronquist, Integr. Syst. Classif. Fl. Pl. 1988; Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard. 85: 531\u2013553. 1998; see also Xiang et al., Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard. 80: 723\u2013734. 1993; Xiang & Soltis in Boufford & Ohba, Sino-Jap. Fl. Charact. Diversif. 123. 1998). Recent phylogenetic analyses of the chloroplast gene rbcL sequences (Xiang et al., loc. cit. 1993; Xiang & Soltis, loc. cit. 1998; Xiang, Harvard Pap. Bot. 4: 527\u2013542. 1999) suggested that nine genera (Aralidium, Aucuba, Corokia, Garrya, Griselinia, Helwingia, Kaliphora, Melanophylla, and Toricellia) were not closely related to Cornaceae. Evidence from other studies, including pollen morphology and wood anatomy (Li & Chao, Quart. J. Taiwan Mus. 7: 119\u2013136. 1954; Ferguson & Hideux, Proc. IV Int. Palynol. Conf., Lucknow 1: 240. 1980; Noshiro & Baas, IAWA J. 19: 43\u201397. 1998; see also Eyde, Bot. Rev. 54: 233\u2013351. 1988), support the removal of these genera from Cornaceae. Various phylogenetic analyses of the rbcL and other chloroplast gene sequences identified a strongly supported monophyletic Cornales consisting of Alangium, Camptotheca, Cornus, Curtisia, Davidia, Diplopanax, Hydrangeaceae, Hydrostachyaceae, Grubbiaceae, Loasaceae, Mastixia, and Nyssa (Chase et al., Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard. 80: 528\u2013580. 1993; Xiang & Soltis, loc. cit. 1998; Xiang, loc. cit. 1999; Olmstead et al., Molec. Phylogen.

Phylogenetic analyses of the rbcL and matK sequences for the Cornales suggested a Cornaceae consisting of Alangium and Cornus, a Grubbiaceae consisting of Curtisia and Grubbia (Xiang et al., Amer. J. Bot. 85: 285\u2013297. 1998; Xiang, loc. cit. 1999; Xiang et al., Molec. Phylogen. Evol. 24: 35\u201357. 2002; Fan & Xiang, Amer. J. Bot. 90: 1357\u20131372. 2003).

Chiogenes, recorded from China in FRPS (57(3): 69\u201371. 1991), is here included in Gaultheria. Over the last half century, the Empetraceae have usually been separated from, but closely associated with, the Ericaceae. In their ecology, leaf morphology and insertion, rusts, embryology, stamen anatomy, etc., they largely agree with that family. Molecular data place Empetrum and its relatives firmly within the Ericaceae, and in particular within the subfamily Ericoideae, in agreement with phytochemical and palynological data, and there they are best recognized as a separate tribe. There are distinctive features of the Empetreae that were responsible for their past familial status, e.g., reduced perianth with separate members, low ovule number, enlarged stigmas, etc. However, these are likely to be derived features associated with wind pollination. See Kron et al. (Bot. Rev. 68: 335\u2013423. 2002) and the recent treatment of the Ericaceae by Stevens et al. (in Kubitzki, Fam. Gen. Vasc. Pl. 6: 145\u2013194. 2004).\r",

Genera 7-10 belong to the Secamonoideae and the remaining genera to the Asclepiadoideae. Many Chinese taxa are known only from dried material, sometimes not well preserved, and it is likely that the study of living or spirit-preserved material could lead to a reassessment of the taxonomy of some of these endemic taxa.  All plant parts, especially the seeds and latex, are often poisonous. They contain various alkaloids and glycosides, many of which are used in medicine and as insecticides.

The most critical feature of the pollen is whether the grain surface is spiny or not. This distinction separates the eight tribes recognized by Austin (Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard. 60: 306-412. 1973) into two rather cohesive groups. A low magnification (20 ) is adequate for discerning the presence or absence of minute spines on the surface. For the successful identification of Convolvulaceae, both flowering and fruiting material should be collected.
