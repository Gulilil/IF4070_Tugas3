      "One of us (Nooteboom) considers that only one genus, Davallia, can be recognized in the Davalliaceae. Paradavallodes multidentata is nested in Araiostegia + Davallodes, which is a polymorphic basal clade. Among species examined, A. hymenophylloides (Blume) Copeland is the type of Araiostegia, and P. multidentata is the type of Paradavallodes. Therefore, the earliest published-Davallodes (Copeland) Copeland-should be used as the generic name. However, from morphology and DNA there are no arguments to recognize this genus. The Humata clade looks quite distinct as an entity, although it contains Davallia corniculata, renamed to H. corniculata by Kato, and in all other systems this is a Davallia. Tsutsumi, Zhang and Kato did not analyze D. wagneriana Copeland and included it in Davallia, but morphologically this is the closest relative of D. corniculata. It should belong to Humata; or better, Humata is part of Davallia (Tsutsumi, Zhang & Kato, Syst. Bot. 33: 44-48. 2008).However, two of us (Xing and Wang) consider that morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies do not support there being only one genus (e.g., Sen, Sen & Holttum, Kew Bull. 27: 217-243. 1972; Kato and Tsutsumi, Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 59: 1-14. 2008; and Tsutsumi, Zhang & Kato, Syst. Bot. 33: 44-48. 2008). A recent study about the leaf epidermis and spore morphology of Davalliaceae (He Chunmei, A taxonomic revision of Davalliaceae in China. Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou. 2012) also supports Araiostegia, Humata, and Paradavallodes as natural genera.Polyploidy, through hybridization and polyploidization, has been assessed in the Humata group, and these polyploids appeared to be apomictic. This could very well also be the case in other groups. With only cpDNA, the phylogeny of a group like this cannot be assessed. Moreover, in Davalliaceae, incongruence between CpDNA and nrDNA is found on the generic level but is not yet explained (C. W. Chen et al., Insights into Evolutionary History of the Humata repens Complex in Taiwan. 5th Symp. Asian Pteridol. Fern Show: Progr. & Abstr. 42. 2010; C. W.

Fronds caespitose or remote from one another, with segments anadromously or catadromously arranged, or sometimes anadromous at base and catadromous distally; stipe often not articulate but sometimes articulate at base, with 3 or more vascular bundles arranged in a semicircle or circle, scaly, sulcate adaxially, not hairy or sometimes hairy; lamina monomorphic or dimorphic, usually oblong, deltoid, pentagonal, lanceolate, ovate, or linear, 1-5-pinnate, or simple, rarely imparipinnate, scaly, glandular, hairy, or glabrous; if scaly then scales bullate or flat; glands absent or present; texture thinly papery, papery, or leathery. Rachises sulcate adaxially, with or without proliferous bulbils, rarely proliferous bulbils borne at a prolonged flagelliform rachis terminal; venation pinnate and free, or variously anastomosing to form 1 to multiple rows of areoles, with or without included veinlets.

Five lineages are defined that can be treated as subfamilies (see Christenhusz et al., Phytotaxa 19: 18-19. 2011) as follows: Loxogrammoideae (Loxogrammaceae): genus no. 1; Drynarioideae (Crypsinoideae, Drynariaceae, Gymnogrammitidaceae): genera nos. 2-8; Platycerioideae (Platyceriaceae, Pyrrosioideae): genera nos. 9-10; Microsoroideae (incl. Crypsinoideae, Lepisorioideae): genera nos. 11-25; Polypodioideae (incl. Grammitidaceae, Pleurosoriopsidaceae): genera nos. 26-39.

      "The number of genera and species in this family has been in considerable flux. Molecular studies (Hasebe et al., Amer. Fern J. 85: 134-181. 1995) have increased our understanding of many fern families, and the placement of many uncertainly placed genera has recently become more evident. The genera Ctenitis (incl. Ataxipteris), Dryopsis (= Dryopteris sect. Dryopsis), and Lastreopsis, which were previously placed in Tectariaceae, are now known to belong to the Dryopteridaceae (Hasebe et al., loc. cit.; Smith et al., Taxon 55: 717. 2006; Liu et al., Sci. China, C, 50: 789-798. 2007) and are treated in that family in this Flora. The two families have always been difficult to separate on a morphological basis, but molecular evidence shows that Tectariaceae in its strict sense is sister to a clade uniting Polypodiaceae, Oleandraceae, and Davalliaceae. The group directly sister to Tectariaceae is Lomariopsidaceae (incl. Nephrolepidaceae), which in turn forms a sister clade to Dryopteridaceae, together forming the Eupolypods I clade (Smith et al., loc. cit.: 707).Few molecular studies have so far addressed the Tectariaceae as a whole, and the generic delimitations are, therefore, far from established. Recent studies suggest that a number of segregate genera is deeply embedded within Tectaria, making it a somewhat polymorphic genus. Here, we have followed this broad concept of Tectaria, and included the genera Ctenitopsis, Hemigramma, and Quercifilix. This is admittedly a conservative approach, but it will have to suffice for the purposes of the present treatment until further studies provide a better understanding and better established delimitation of the genera within Tectariaceae.Pleocnemia and Pteridrys are maintained as separate from Tectaria s.l. because they show sufficient molecular and morphological distinctness. Pleocnemia was tentatively placed in Dryopteridaceae by Liu et al. (loc. cit.), but evidence for this is scarce, and we, therefore, maintain it here in Tectariaceae following Smith et al. (loc. cit.: 718), until further data are available.The following taxon, described from China, is excluded from the present treatment, pending further research: Sagenia cicutaria (Linnaeus) T.

      "The family* is very natural and is distinguished from others by having grayish white unicellular acicular hairs and pubescence throughout the plant. However, there are many different viewpoints about generic circumscription in the family. Ching recognized 18 genera (including Hypodematium) in his 1963 treatment (Acta Phytotax. Sin. 8: 289-335); soon afterward, in 1978 (Ching, Acta Phytotax. Sin. 16(3): 12-13), the number of recognized genera in China grew to 20 (Hypodematium was removed and placed in its own family). In 1971, Holttum subdivided this family in the Paleotropics into 23 genera (Blumea 19(1): 17-52). In 1977, Pichi Sermolli, mainly following Holttum, circumscribed other genera for a total of 32 genera (Webbia 3(2): 213-512). In 1990, A. R. Smith divided the family into five genera (in Kramer & Green, Fam. Gen. Vasc. Pl. 1: 263-272), i.e., Thelypteris (including five subgenera), Phegopteris, Pseudophegopteris, Macrothelypteris, and Cyclosorus (including 20 subgenera). Of the many systems, those of Holttum and Pichi Sermolli divide the family most finely, with the greatest number of genera. Holttum (loc. cit.) segregated the following genera from Cyclosorus s.l.: Amphineuron, Christella, Pneumatopteris, and Sphaerostephanos. Recognition of these genera was based on several characters, including whether the proximal pinnae were shortened or not, and whether the sporangia and sporangial stalks bore hairs or glandular hairs. Holttum (loc. cit.) also segregated several genera (e.g., Parathelypteris and Coryphopteris) from the classical Thelypteris s.l., the free-veined thelypteroids, by characters that included rhizome habit, laminar glands, and chromosome base number. Smith (loc. cit.: 265) noted: \"Although many of Holttum\u0092s genera seem natural (i.e., monophyletic), a combination of characters must be used to circumscribe them. Some of the characters concern minute glands and hairs and require 30 \u00d7 magnification or greater for observation. Others require that complete specimens be at hand (including lower part of blade and stem). Even then, identification to genus may be difficult, as generic lines are not always sharp.\" The question of generic delimitation within the family needs further study, but for now we adopt Ching\u0092s system (1978), modified from Ching (1963).***In 1940, Ching established many new families (Sunyatsenia 5(4): 237), including Thelypteridaceae with 12 genera, but the names of these new families are nomina nuda and were not therefore validly published (Melbourne Code, Art. 38.1(a)). Only in 1970 were these families formally published by Pichi Sermolli.**(1) Holttum set up the genus Amphineuron with mixed characters in 1971, which was also adopted by Ching in 1978. Among the 12 recognized species in the genus, three occur in China: the type species A. opulentum, which is similar to Cyclosorus in venation and lemon-yellow glands; A. immersum, which is similar to Parathelypteris species in venation; and A. tonkinensis, which has already been removed to a new genus, Mesopteris. As Holttum himself considered Amphineuron to be a provisional treatment, this genus is not adopted here.(2) Trichoneuron Ching (Acta Phytotax. Sin. 10: 118, pl. 22. 1967) was based on a single gathering, and the collection locality was unknown. Later, this species was rediscovered by Prof. W. M. Chu in Pingbian, SE Yunnan. According to Prof. Chu\u0092s study, it belongs to the genus Lastreopsis (Dryopteridaceae). It is, therefore, not included here.Using only venation, the family may be divided into 3 tribes: 1. Tribe Thelypterideae Ching: Veins free; with two subtypes: (1) all veinlets reaching margins or nearly reaching margins above sinuses between segments, with the bottom of sinuses not cartilaginous (e.g., Parathelypteris); (2) proximal pair of veinlets from adjacent segments reaching cartilaginous sinuses but not united; or acroscopic veinlet of basal pair of veinlets reaching cartilaginous sinus, basiscopic veinlet reaching margin above sinus (e.g., Pseudocyclosorus and Mesopteris); 2. Tribe Goniopterideae Ching: Veins partly combined; at least proximal pair of veinlets from adjacent segments united to form triangular areoles and this vein union producing a long or short excurrent veinlet; additional areoles may be produced in the same row, by subsequent vein unions of veinlets; excurrent veinlets may connect with more distal vein unions, or with a translucent line leading to a sinus, thus forming oblique rhomboid areoles (goniopteroid venation) (e.g., Cyclosorus, Ampelopteris), or squarish areoles (meniscioid venation) (e.g., Pronephrium, the areoles without included veinlets; 3. Tribe Dictyoclineae Ching: Veinlets between lateral veins all combined into irregular squarish or pentagonal areoles and each areole sometimes with simple or forked included veinlets.The following taxon is excluded from the present treatment, pending further research: Thelypteris calvata Ching (Bull.

      "In this account, the Cupressaceae are treated sensu stricto, i.e., excluding those taxa that are traditionally classified in Taxodiaceae. A merger of these two families is substantially supported by both morphological and molecular evidence (the Cupressaceae form a clearcut monophyletic group derived from within the Taxodiaceae). No consistent characters separate them, while the homology of the reproductive organs, so fundamentally different from other conifer families, appears to unite them phylogenetically. However, the traditional family concept, as adopted in FRPS, has been maintained here for pragmatic reasons. In FRPS, it was stated that Microbiota decussata Komarov had been said to grow in NE China, but that no material had been seen. This species is known with certainty only from the Sikhote Alin range of E Russia (Primorye), not far from the Chinese border, where it grows on mountains above the timberline. It resembles a spreading Juniperus but has minute, dehiscent, 1-seeded cones, and should be searched for in comparable areas in E Heilongjiang. One endemic species, Thuja sutchuenensis, has apparently become extinct in the wild in historic times.

Brown, Lampranthus spectabilis (Haworth) N. E. Brown, and Mesembryanthemum crystallinum Linnaeus.

Pseudostaminodia are interstaminal appendages with variously shaped apices. Filament appendages are the lateral appendages of filaments (one on each side). The basic structure of the inflorescence is the cyme (branchlets arising from the bracteole axils, the bracteoles serving as bracts for upper flowers), which can be reduced to one flower with two bracteoles and a bract. Units of dispersal vary considerably (capsules opening with lower part persistent, flower and bracteoles falling together, or cymose partial inflorescences breaking off above bract) and can be characteristic for genera. Several genera possess long trichomes serving dispersal at the base of the tepals.Digera arvensis Forssk\u00e5l (Fl. Aegypt.-Arab. 65. 1775) has been reported from Anhui.
