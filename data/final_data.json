      "One of us (Nooteboom) considers that only one genus, Davallia, can be recognized in the Davalliaceae. Paradavallodes multidentata is nested in Araiostegia + Davallodes, which is a polymorphic basal clade. Among species examined, A. hymenophylloides (Blume) Copeland is the type of Araiostegia, and P. multidentata is the type of Paradavallodes. Therefore, the earliest published-Davallodes (Copeland) Copeland-should be used as the generic name. However, from morphology and DNA there are no arguments to recognize this genus. The Humata clade looks quite distinct as an entity, although it contains Davallia corniculata, renamed to H. corniculata by Kato, and in all other systems this is a Davallia. Tsutsumi, Zhang and Kato did not analyze D. wagneriana Copeland and included it in Davallia, but morphologically this is the closest relative of D. corniculata. It should belong to Humata; or better, Humata is part of Davallia (Tsutsumi, Zhang & Kato, Syst. Bot. 33: 44-48. 2008).However, two of us (Xing and Wang) consider that morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies do not support there being only one genus (e.g., Sen, Sen & Holttum, Kew Bull. 27: 217-243. 1972; Kato and Tsutsumi, Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 59: 1-14. 2008; and Tsutsumi, Zhang & Kato, Syst. Bot. 33: 44-48. 2008). A recent study about the leaf epidermis and spore morphology of Davalliaceae (He Chunmei, A taxonomic revision of Davalliaceae in China. Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou. 2012) also supports Araiostegia, Humata, and Paradavallodes as natural genera.Polyploidy, through hybridization and polyploidization, has been assessed in the Humata group, and these polyploids appeared to be apomictic. This could very well also be the case in other groups. With only cpDNA, the phylogeny of a group like this cannot be assessed. Moreover, in Davalliaceae, incongruence between CpDNA and nrDNA is found on the generic level but is not yet explained (C. W. Chen et al., Insights into Evolutionary History of the Humata repens Complex in Taiwan. 5th Symp. Asian Pteridol. Fern Show: Progr. & Abstr. 42. 2010; C. W.

Fronds caespitose or remote from one another, with segments anadromously or catadromously arranged, or sometimes anadromous at base and catadromous distally; stipe often not articulate but sometimes articulate at base, with 3 or more vascular bundles arranged in a semicircle or circle, scaly, sulcate adaxially, not hairy or sometimes hairy; lamina monomorphic or dimorphic, usually oblong, deltoid, pentagonal, lanceolate, ovate, or linear, 1-5-pinnate, or simple, rarely imparipinnate, scaly, glandular, hairy, or glabrous; if scaly then scales bullate or flat; glands absent or present; texture thinly papery, papery, or leathery. Rachises sulcate adaxially, with or without proliferous bulbils, rarely proliferous bulbils borne at a prolonged flagelliform rachis terminal; venation pinnate and free, or variously anastomosing to form 1 to multiple rows of areoles, with or without included veinlets.

Five lineages are defined that can be treated as subfamilies (see Christenhusz et al., Phytotaxa 19: 18-19. 2011) as follows: Loxogrammoideae (Loxogrammaceae): genus no. 1; Drynarioideae (Crypsinoideae, Drynariaceae, Gymnogrammitidaceae): genera nos. 2-8; Platycerioideae (Platyceriaceae, Pyrrosioideae): genera nos. 9-10; Microsoroideae (incl. Crypsinoideae, Lepisorioideae): genera nos. 11-25; Polypodioideae (incl. Grammitidaceae, Pleurosoriopsidaceae): genera nos. 26-39.

      "The number of genera and species in this family has been in considerable flux. Molecular studies (Hasebe et al., Amer. Fern J. 85: 134-181. 1995) have increased our understanding of many fern families, and the placement of many uncertainly placed genera has recently become more evident. The genera Ctenitis (incl. Ataxipteris), Dryopsis (= Dryopteris sect. Dryopsis), and Lastreopsis, which were previously placed in Tectariaceae, are now known to belong to the Dryopteridaceae (Hasebe et al., loc. cit.; Smith et al., Taxon 55: 717. 2006; Liu et al., Sci. China, C, 50: 789-798. 2007) and are treated in that family in this Flora. The two families have always been difficult to separate on a morphological basis, but molecular evidence shows that Tectariaceae in its strict sense is sister to a clade uniting Polypodiaceae, Oleandraceae, and Davalliaceae. The group directly sister to Tectariaceae is Lomariopsidaceae (incl. Nephrolepidaceae), which in turn forms a sister clade to Dryopteridaceae, together forming the Eupolypods I clade (Smith et al., loc. cit.: 707).Few molecular studies have so far addressed the Tectariaceae as a whole, and the generic delimitations are, therefore, far from established. Recent studies suggest that a number of segregate genera is deeply embedded within Tectaria, making it a somewhat polymorphic genus. Here, we have followed this broad concept of Tectaria, and included the genera Ctenitopsis, Hemigramma, and Quercifilix. This is admittedly a conservative approach, but it will have to suffice for the purposes of the present treatment until further studies provide a better understanding and better established delimitation of the genera within Tectariaceae.Pleocnemia and Pteridrys are maintained as separate from Tectaria s.l. because they show sufficient molecular and morphological distinctness. Pleocnemia was tentatively placed in Dryopteridaceae by Liu et al. (loc. cit.), but evidence for this is scarce, and we, therefore, maintain it here in Tectariaceae following Smith et al. (loc. cit.: 718), until further data are available.The following taxon, described from China, is excluded from the present treatment, pending further research: Sagenia cicutaria (Linnaeus) T.

      "The family* is very natural and is distinguished from others by having grayish white unicellular acicular hairs and pubescence throughout the plant. However, there are many different viewpoints about generic circumscription in the family. Ching recognized 18 genera (including Hypodematium) in his 1963 treatment (Acta Phytotax. Sin. 8: 289-335); soon afterward, in 1978 (Ching, Acta Phytotax. Sin. 16(3): 12-13), the number of recognized genera in China grew to 20 (Hypodematium was removed and placed in its own family). In 1971, Holttum subdivided this family in the Paleotropics into 23 genera (Blumea 19(1): 17-52). In 1977, Pichi Sermolli, mainly following Holttum, circumscribed other genera for a total of 32 genera (Webbia 3(2): 213-512). In 1990, A. R. Smith divided the family into five genera (in Kramer & Green, Fam. Gen. Vasc. Pl. 1: 263-272), i.e., Thelypteris (including five subgenera), Phegopteris, Pseudophegopteris, Macrothelypteris, and Cyclosorus (including 20 subgenera). Of the many systems, those of Holttum and Pichi Sermolli divide the family most finely, with the greatest number of genera. Holttum (loc. cit.) segregated the following genera from Cyclosorus s.l.: Amphineuron, Christella, Pneumatopteris, and Sphaerostephanos. Recognition of these genera was based on several characters, including whether the proximal pinnae were shortened or not, and whether the sporangia and sporangial stalks bore hairs or glandular hairs. Holttum (loc. cit.) also segregated several genera (e.g., Parathelypteris and Coryphopteris) from the classical Thelypteris s.l., the free-veined thelypteroids, by characters that included rhizome habit, laminar glands, and chromosome base number. Smith (loc. cit.: 265) noted: \"Although many of Holttum\u0092s genera seem natural (i.e., monophyletic), a combination of characters must be used to circumscribe them. Some of the characters concern minute glands and hairs and require 30 \u00d7 magnification or greater for observation. Others require that complete specimens be at hand (including lower part of blade and stem). Even then, identification to genus may be difficult, as generic lines are not always sharp.\" The question of generic delimitation within the family needs further study, but for now we adopt Ching\u0092s system (1978), modified from Ching (1963).***In 1940, Ching established many new families (Sunyatsenia 5(4): 237), including Thelypteridaceae with 12 genera, but the names of these new families are nomina nuda and were not therefore validly published (Melbourne Code, Art. 38.1(a)). Only in 1970 were these families formally published by Pichi Sermolli.**(1) Holttum set up the genus Amphineuron with mixed characters in 1971, which was also adopted by Ching in 1978. Among the 12 recognized species in the genus, three occur in China: the type species A. opulentum, which is similar to Cyclosorus in venation and lemon-yellow glands; A. immersum, which is similar to Parathelypteris species in venation; and A. tonkinensis, which has already been removed to a new genus, Mesopteris. As Holttum himself considered Amphineuron to be a provisional treatment, this genus is not adopted here.(2) Trichoneuron Ching (Acta Phytotax. Sin. 10: 118, pl. 22. 1967) was based on a single gathering, and the collection locality was unknown. Later, this species was rediscovered by Prof. W. M. Chu in Pingbian, SE Yunnan. According to Prof. Chu\u0092s study, it belongs to the genus Lastreopsis (Dryopteridaceae). It is, therefore, not included here.Using only venation, the family may be divided into 3 tribes: 1. Tribe Thelypterideae Ching: Veins free; with two subtypes: (1) all veinlets reaching margins or nearly reaching margins above sinuses between segments, with the bottom of sinuses not cartilaginous (e.g., Parathelypteris); (2) proximal pair of veinlets from adjacent segments reaching cartilaginous sinuses but not united; or acroscopic veinlet of basal pair of veinlets reaching cartilaginous sinus, basiscopic veinlet reaching margin above sinus (e.g., Pseudocyclosorus and Mesopteris); 2. Tribe Goniopterideae Ching: Veins partly combined; at least proximal pair of veinlets from adjacent segments united to form triangular areoles and this vein union producing a long or short excurrent veinlet; additional areoles may be produced in the same row, by subsequent vein unions of veinlets; excurrent veinlets may connect with more distal vein unions, or with a translucent line leading to a sinus, thus forming oblique rhomboid areoles (goniopteroid venation) (e.g., Cyclosorus, Ampelopteris), or squarish areoles (meniscioid venation) (e.g., Pronephrium, the areoles without included veinlets; 3. Tribe Dictyoclineae Ching: Veinlets between lateral veins all combined into irregular squarish or pentagonal areoles and each areole sometimes with simple or forked included veinlets.The following taxon is excluded from the present treatment, pending further research: Thelypteris calvata Ching (Bull.

      "In this account, the Cupressaceae are treated sensu stricto, i.e., excluding those taxa that are traditionally classified in Taxodiaceae. A merger of these two families is substantially supported by both morphological and molecular evidence (the Cupressaceae form a clearcut monophyletic group derived from within the Taxodiaceae). No consistent characters separate them, while the homology of the reproductive organs, so fundamentally different from other conifer families, appears to unite them phylogenetically. However, the traditional family concept, as adopted in FRPS, has been maintained here for pragmatic reasons. In FRPS, it was stated that Microbiota decussata Komarov had been said to grow in NE China, but that no material had been seen. This species is known with certainty only from the Sikhote Alin range of E Russia (Primorye), not far from the Chinese border, where it grows on mountains above the timberline. It resembles a spreading Juniperus but has minute, dehiscent, 1-seeded cones, and should be searched for in comparable areas in E Heilongjiang. One endemic species, Thuja sutchuenensis, has apparently become extinct in the wild in historic times.

Brown, Lampranthus spectabilis (Haworth) N. E. Brown, and Mesembryanthemum crystallinum Linnaeus.

Pseudostaminodia are interstaminal appendages with variously shaped apices. Filament appendages are the lateral appendages of filaments (one on each side). The basic structure of the inflorescence is the cyme (branchlets arising from the bracteole axils, the bracteoles serving as bracts for upper flowers), which can be reduced to one flower with two bracteoles and a bract. Units of dispersal vary considerably (capsules opening with lower part persistent, flower and bracteoles falling together, or cymose partial inflorescences breaking off above bract) and can be characteristic for genera. Several genera possess long trichomes serving dispersal at the base of the tepals.Digera arvensis Forssk\u00e5l (Fl. Aegypt.-Arab. 65. 1775) has been reported from Anhui.

      "The Lauraceae are economically important as sources of medicine, timber, nutritious fruits (e.g., Persea americana), spices (e.g., Cinnamomum cassia, C. subavenium, Laurus nobilis), and perfumes. The fruits of Actinodaphne, Cinnamomum, Cryptocarya, Lindera, Litsea, and Syndiclis contain abundant oil and fat. Cinnamomum trees, such as Cinnamomum camphora, C. glanduliferum, and C. parthenoxylon, yield camphor and essential oil, which are used for making perfumes and medicines. The bark of C. cassia and the roots of Lindera aggregata are famous traditional Chinese medicines.The Chinese species of Lauraceae remain poorly known and difficult to identify. The main reason for this is that for a substantial number of species the fruits or flowers are not known. This makes generic placement of such species uncertain, since most genera are defined by floral characters. A second problem is that characters of both flowers and fruits are used in most generic keys and since specimens almost never bear both flowers and fruits, identification is often almost impossible. A drastic remedy for this problem would be to make keys based on flowering specimens and list species known only with fruits as incompletely known species and not include them in the keys. This approach has not been followed in this treatment.The genera are here maintained as they have been recognized in earlier works on Chinese Lauraceae. The present authors are aware that this will seem inconsistent; for instance, in the case of Sassafras, species with 2-celled and 4-celled anthers are included in the same genus, while in other cases pairs of genera are separated based on this character (for example Lindera-Litsea, Alseodaphne-Nothaphoebe, and Parasassafras-Sinosassafras). Generic boundaries in the Litsea group (Actinodaphne, Dodecadenia, Iteadaphne, Lindera, Litsea, Neolitsea, Parasassafras, and Sinosassafras) are not well defined, and generic concepts are likely to change after further research.Aside from these problems, there are a number of vegetative characters that are helpful in the identification process. They are listed below.Leaves opposite or subopposite: Beilschmiedia p.p., Caryodaphnopsis, Cinnamomum p.p.Leaves verticillate or clustered: Actinodaphne, Neolitsea; rarely in Lindera (L. megaphylla) and Litsea (L. verticillata); weakly clustered in Alseodaphne, Dehaasia, Machilus, Phoebe.Leaves triplinerved and alternate: Cinnamomum p.p., Cryptocarya p.p., Lindera p.p., Neocinnamomum.Leaves triplinerved and clustered: Neolitsea.Leaves triplinerved and opposite: Caryodaphnopsis, Cinnamomum p.p.Leaves lobed: Lindera p.p., Sassafras.Leaves with tufts of hairs in axils of lateral veins: Cinnamomum p.p.The three genera Machilus, Persea, and Phoebe cannot be identified adequately by floral characters; they have been separated traditionally on the fruit characters listed in the key.Li Hsi-wen et al. 1982. Lauraceae. In: Li Hsi-wen, ed., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 31: 1-463.One of the present authors (van der Werff) provides this alternative key to genera.

      "Several species in the Magnolioideae are grown for their dried flower buds, known as xinyi (\u8f9b\u5937), which are used medicinally. In addition, HOUPOEA officinalis (Magnolia officinalis) is extensively grown for its medicinal bark. All species in the family are ornamental, and many are grown in public and private gardens throughout much of China and in other parts of the world.One of the co-authors (Nooteboom) considers the Magnoliaceae to include two monogeneric subfamilies, with Magnolioideae containing the genus Magnolia and Liriodendroideae containing the genus Liriodendron. The reduction of the former genera of Magnolioideae to a single genus is based on DNA analysis (S. Kim et al., Amer. J. Bot. 88: 717-728. 2001; H. Azuma et al., J. Plant Res. 112: 291-306. 1999; H. Azuma et al., Proc. Int. Symp. Fam. Magnoliac. 1988, 219-227. 2000; H. Azuma et al., Amer. J. Bot. 88: 2275-2285. 2001; W. S. Judd et al., Pl. Syst. Phylogenet. Approach, 222-224. 1999) and morphology (R. B. Figlar, Proc. Int. Symp. Fam. Magnoliac. 1988, 14-25. 2000; R. B. Figlar & H. P. Nooteboom, Blumea 49: 87-100. 2004). In the present treatment, not only are previously recognized genera still included but additional new and\/or reinstated segregate genera of Magnolioideae are recognized.Nooteboom observes problems in the present treatment of segregate genera. An example of morphological similarity, which is strengthened by DNA results, is the similar fruit of Michelia species and Yulania (Magnolia) stellata. The present treatment distinguishes Michelia and Yulania on the basis of pseudoaxillary flowers in Michelia, but Y. stellata also has pseudoaxillary flowers. Furthermore, the emphasis given to fruit characters in order to separate genera is inconsistent, which renders the key to genera unworkable for specimens that lack fruit. Michelia (Magnolia) baillonii has fruit with connate carpels and is regarded as a Michelia species, although, even with fruit, it cannot be determined to Michelia and instead keys out as Talauma. The same character, fruit with connate carpels, is used to distinguish T. (Magnolia) hodgsonii from Lirianthe, even though, in the absence of fruit, it can hardly or not at all be distinguished from L. (Magnolia) henryi.The following checklist is provided for the benefit of those who prefer to recognize Magnolioideae to include only the genus Magnolia. All the names in Magnolioideae accepted in the present treatment (in italics) are cross-referenced to the corresponding names in Magnolia (in boldface), with the latter followed by full bibliographic references. Except for treating Magnolioideae as monogeneric, the taxonomy at the specific and infraspecific levels in this checklist differs from the following main text of this treatment only in that one co-author (Nooteboom) considers that Magnolia fordiana var. calcarea, M. fordiana var. forrestii, M. figo var. crassipes, and M. figo var. skinneriana should be recognized rather than be treated as species.",

      "Herbs annual, biennial, or perennial, sometimes subshrubs or shrubs, with a pungent, watery juice. Eglandular trichomes unicellular, simple, stalked or sessile, 2- to many forked, stellate, dendritic, or malpighiaceous (medifixed, bifid, appressed), rarely peltate and scalelike; glandular trichomes multicellular, with uniseriate or multiseriate stalk. Stems erect, ascending, or prostrate, sometimes absent. Leaves exstipulate, simple, entire or variously pinnately dissected, rarely trifoliolate or pinnately, palmately, or bipinnately compound; basal leaf rosette present or absent; cauline leaves almost always alternate, rarely opposite or whorled, petiolate or sessile, sometimes absent. Inflorescence bracteate or ebracteate racemes, corymbs, or panicles, sometimes flowers solitary on long pedicels originating from axils of rosette leaves. Flowers hypogynous, mostly actinomorphic. Sepals 4, in 2 decussate pairs, free or rarely united, not saccate or lateral (inner) pair saccate. Petals 4, alternate with sepals, arranged in the form of a cross (cruciform; hence the earlier family name Cruciferae), rarely rudimentary or absent. Stamens 6, in 2 whorls, tetradynamous (lateral (outer) pair shorter than median (inner) 2 pairs), rarely equal or in 3 pairs of unequal length, sometimes stamens 2 or 4, very rarely 8-24; filaments slender, winged, or appendaged, median pairs free or rarely united; anthers dithecal, dehiscing by longitudinal slits. Pollen grains 3-colpate, trinucleate. Nectar glands receptacular, highly diversified in number, shape, size, and disposition around base of filaments, always present opposite bases of lateral filaments, median glands present or absent. Pistil 2-carpelled; ovary superior, sessile or borne on a distinct gynophore, mostly 2-locular and with a false septum connecting 2 placentae; placentation parietal, rarely apical; ovules anatropous or campylotropous, bitegmic, 1 to many per locule. Fruit typically a 2-valved capsule, generally termed silique (siliqua) when length 3 \u00d7 or more than width, or silicle (silicula) when length less than 3 \u00d7 width, dehiscent or indehiscent, sometimes schizocarpic, nutletlike, lomentaceous, or samaroid, segmented or not, terete, angled, or flattened parallel to septum (latiseptate) or at a right angle to septum (angustiseptate); valves 2(or 3-6); replum (persistent placenta) rounded, rarely flattened or winged; septum complete, perforated, reduced to a rim, or lacking; style 1, distinct, obsolete, or absent; stigma capitate or conical, entire or 2-lobed, sometimes lobes decurrent and free or connate. Seeds without endosperm, uniseriately or biseriately arranged in each locule, aseriate when 1, winged or wingless, mucilaginous or not when wetted; cotyledons incumbent (embryo notorrhizal: radicle lying along back of 1 cotyledon), accumbent (embryo pleurorrhizal: radicle applied to margins of both cotyledons), or conduplicate (embryo orthoplocal: cotyledons folded longitudinally around radicle), rarely spirally coiled (embryo spirolobal). Germination epigeal.\r",
      "About 330 genera and 3500 species: all continents except Antarctica, mainly in temperate areas, with highest diversity in Irano-Turanian, Mediterranean, and W North American regions; 102 genera (eight endemic) and 412 species (115 endemic) in China.",
      "Because of lack of a comprehensive classification based on phylogenetic relationships among genera, and in order to facilitate direct comparison between the accounts in FOC and FRPS, the sequence of genera follows Schulz (Nat. Pflanzenfam. 17b: 227-658. 1936). However, it should be emphasized that his system is largely artificial because he placed closely related genera in different tribes and remotely related genera in the same tribe. For example, Arabis, Aubrieta, Draba, and Macropodium, which are very closely related on the basis of recent molecular studies, were placed by Schulz in four different tribes, whereas the unrelated Capsella, Lepidium, and Thlaspi were placed in one tribe. The delimitation of genera is often difficult, and mature fruits are needed for reliable identification.The Brassicaceae include many important crop plants that are grown as vegetables (Brassica, Nasturtium, Raphanus) and sources of vegetable oils (Brassica) and condiments (Armoracia, Brassica, Eutrema, Sinapis). Oils of Brassica probably rank first in terms of tonnage of the world's production of edible oils. The family includes many ornamentals in the genera Erysimum, Iberis Linnaeus, Lobularia, Malcolmia, and Matthiola. Of these, only Lobularia maritima has become naturalized in China. The family also includes more than 120 species of weeds. Arabidopsis thaliana, which is naturalized in China, has become the model organism in many fields of experimental biology.The delimitation of genera in the Brassicaceae is often difficult because of the frequent independent evolution of what appear to be similar character states, the variability of a given character in one genus and its fixture in another, and the inadequate sampling of material by most authors. Fruit characters are essential in the identification of genera. However, a key emphasizing flowering material is given in addition to the one emphasizing fruit. The most reliable determination of genera can be achieved when the material has both fruit and flowers and when both keys are successfully used to reach the same genus.The types of cotyledonary position, which in reality is the position of the radicle in relation to the cotyledons (e.g., radicle accumbent, incumbent, or conduplicate, though radicle referred to as \"cotyledon\" throughout) are important in the separation of many genera, and a cross section of the seed provides the easiest and simplest way of determining that position. The exact number of ovules per ovary can easily be determined from the fruit because aborted ovules persist through fruit dehiscence. However, it is more laborious to determine the ovule number from pistils and young fruit.Cheo Tai-yien, Guo Rong-lin, Lan Young-zhen, Lou Lian-li, Kuan Ke-chien & An Zheng-xi. 1987. Cruciferae.

      "During the past several years, cladistic analyses of morphological, chemical, and DNA data have made it clear that the recognition of the Saxifragaceae sensu lato (Engler, Nat. Pflanzenfam. 18a: 74-226. 1928) is untenable. Among the angiosperm families, Saxifragaceae sensu lato may in fact represent the most extreme example of a polyphyletic assemblage. For example, recent analyses of DNA sequence data indicate that these taxa represent at least ten separate evolutionary lines, many of which are only distantly related to one another (Morgan & Soltis, Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard. 80: 631-660. 1993; Soltis & Soltis, Amer. J. Bot. 84: 504-522. 1997). Furthermore, very large molecular phylogenetic analyses of hundreds of angiosperms indicate that these separate lineages are distributed among four of the six traditionally recognized subclasses of dicotyledons (Savolainen et al., Syst. Biol. 49: 306-362. 2000; Soltis et al., Nature 402: 402-404. 1999). These recent studies have also greatly clarified how this phylogenetically diverse assemblage should be divided into families and treated taxonomically (see The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG), Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard. 85: 531-553. 1998). Recent studies of DNA sequence data have clarified both the circumscription and affinities of a narrowly defined Saxifragaceae (Saxifragaceae sensu stricto) and Hydrangeaceae (Soltis et al., Amer. J. Bot. 82: 504-514. 1995; Savolainen et al., loc. cit.; Soltis et al., loc. cit. 1999). Saxifragaceae sensu stricto should consist only of Saxifragoideae, a group of about 30 herbaceous genera. Members of Saxifragaceae sensu stricto from the Chinese flora include Astilbe, Astilboides, Bergenia, Chrysosplenium, Mitella, Mukdenia, Oresitrophe, Rodgersia, Saxifraga, Tanakaea, Tiarella, and the recently described Saniculiphyllum. Close relatives of Saxifragaceae sensu stricto include Itea, Penthorum, and Ribes. These genera, the sole members of Iteoideae, Penthoroideae, and Ribesioideae, respectively, are also best treated in separate families: Iteaceae, Penthoraceae, and Grossulariaceae (see APG, loc. cit.). These taxa, as well as several others, such as Crassulaceae, are basal to a large assemblage of taxa, most of which were traditionally placed in Rosidae. Sequence data also indicate that Parnassia (the sole member of the Parnassioideae) is a more derived member of the rosid alliance, most closely related to Brexia and Lepuropetalon (also part of Saxifragaceae sensu lato) and Celastraceae. Parnassia and Lepuropetalon should be placed in Parnassiaceae with Brexia part of an expanded Celastraceae (APG, loc. cit.).Both morphological and molecular data indicate that Hydrangeoideae and Escallonioideae are, in contrast, allied with taxa traditionally placed in Asteridae. Hydrangeoideae are a well-defined, monophyletic lineage that should be treated as Hydrangeaceae. In China they include Cardiandra, Decumaria, Deinanthe, Deutzia, Dichroa, Hydrangea, Kirengeshoma, Philadelphus, Pileostegia, Platycrater, and Schizophragma, and are closely allied with families such as Cornaceae, Loasaceae, and Nyssaceae. Escallonioideae appear to be polyphyletic, and this group of approximately 14 genera is in need of thorough study. Members of this subfamily are allied with several different lineages of higher asterids. Polyosma, the only member of Escallonioideae in China, appears closely allied with Caprifoliaceae (Xiang & Soltis in Boufford & Ohba, Sino-Japanese Flora: its Characteristics and Diversification, 1998).Nevertheless, in the present account, the Saxifragaceae are retained in the sense of FRPS, using the same sequence of genera and indicating the subfamilies in the key below, in order to facilitate comparison with that flora.The genus Changiodendron R. H. Miao (Acta Sci. Nat. Univ. Sunyatseni 34: 65. 1995) and its single species, C. guangxiense R. H. Miao (loc. cit.: 66), was described from Guangxi (Napo Xian) and stated to belong to the Iteaceae (i.e., Iteoideae). However, Peng (Acta Bot. Yunnan. 18: 299-300. 1996) demonstrated that C. guangxiense is a synonym of Sabia parviflora Wallich (Sabiaceae).Pan Jin-tang. 1992. Saxifragaceae (1) [Penthoroideae, Saxifragoideae].

In China, the resinous sap of Toxicodendron vernicifluum and T. succedaneum is called Chinese lacquer. Rhus chinensis is the host plant of the aphid Melaphis chinensis that produces the \"Chinese gall,\" which in turn is a rich source of gallic acid. Anacardium occidentale and Mangifera indica are widely cultivated as fruit trees, and Pistacia chinensis yields a natural yellow dye. Several plants have ornamental value, such as Cotinus coggygria var. cinerea, which produces spectacular red leaves in the autumn.The resinous sap of Anacardiaceae hardens and turns black when exposed to the air. Some species in the family, especially of Toxicodendron and Semecarpus, can cause severe dermatitis after contact, especially in persons who have been sensitized by long-term exposure to the plants.Ming Tien lu. 1980.

Comber in the Celastraceae (see p. 472).Ilex nokoensis Hayata (J. Coll. Sci. Imp. Univ. Tokyo 30(1): 56. 1911) is the basionym of Symplocos nokoensis (Hayata) Kanehira in the Symplocaceae (see Fl. China 15: 244. 1996).Ilex racemosa Oliver is the basionym of Perrottetia racemosa (Oliver) Loesener in the Dipentodontaceae (see p. 495).Ilex rarasanensis Sasaki (Trans. Nat. Hist. Soc. Formosa 21: 154. 1931), described from Taiwan, could not be treated here because we did not see the type material."

Leaves alternate or opposite, rarely whorled; stipules usually present, often free, sometimes modified into spines or glands, deciduous or persistent; petioles long to short, sometimes with glands at apex or base; leaf blade simple, sometimes palmately lobed, rarely compound, or reduced to scales, margins entire or toothed, sometimes with distinct glands along margin and\/or on surface, venation pinnate or palmate. Inflorescences axillary or terminal, flowers in cymes or fascicles, these often arranged along an elongated axis, branched or unbranched, forming a thyrse, in congested heads, or in a flowerlike cyathium with very reduced flowers enclosed within a \u00b1 cupular involucre; bracts sometimes petaloid. Flowers unisexual, within same inflorescence or in separate inflorescences, actinomorphic. Sepals (1-)3-6(-8), free or connate into calyx tube, valvate or imbricate, rarely absent (Euphorbia). Petals free, often reduced or absent. Disk present or absent. Male flowers with disk intrastaminal or extrastaminal, entire to dissected. Stamens one to very many, hypogynous; filaments free or connate; anthers 2(-4)-locular, mostly dehiscing longitudinally, rarely transversely or by pores, introrse or extrorse; rudimentary ovary sometimes present. Female flowers rarely with staminodes; ovary superior, (1-)2-5(-20)-locular; placentation axile; ovules 1 or 2 per locule, anatropous or hemitropous; styles free or connate, entire or lobed, or multifid, lobes erect, horizontal or curved; stigma capitate, linear, fimbriate, fan-shaped or pinnatilobate. Fruit typically a capsule elastically dehiscent into 2-valved cocci from a persistent columella, sometimes a berry or drupe. Seeds 1 or 2 per locule; seed coat thin to indurate, sometimes fleshy to form a sarcotesta; caruncle sometimes present; aril sometimes present; endosperm present or absent; embryo straight to curved or folded; cotyledons usually broader than radical. x = 6-14.Trees, shrubs, or herbs, usually without latex (present in Bischofia); indumentum of simple hairs (branched in Phyllanthus reticulatus), often absent. Leaves alternate, often distichous, sometimes scalelike on main stems; petiole usually short, usually without glands (present in Aporosa); leaf blade simple, margin entire or minutely serrulate (long petioles, 3(-5)-foliolate with toothed margins in Bischofia); venation pinnate, rarely obscurely 3-veined from base. Inflorescences mostly axillary, without visible axis (present in Antidesma, Aporosa, Baccaurea, Bischofia, Richeriella). Male flowers with 2-8 stamens, anthers longitudinally dehiscent (variable in Phyllanthus); female flowers with 2 ovules per locule. Seeds without caruncle, sometimes with fleshy aril or fleshy testa.Trees to shrubs. Leaf blade leathery, grayish when dry, base often asymmetrical. Ovules 1 per locule; stigmas dilated, peltate or reniform. Fruit a relatively large 1-seeded drupe, usually crowned by persistent flaplike stigmas. Seeds without caruncle.Plants with or without latex; indumentum of simple, stellate, scalelike, stinging, or glandular hairs, sometimes absent. Leaves alternate or opposite; leaf blade simple or compound, sometimes deeply divided, margin entire or variously toothed, often with sessile glands near junction with petiole and\/or along margins; venation pinnate or palmate. Inflorescences basically thyrsoid, very variable, often with well-defined main axis and\/or distinct cymes, rarely a sessile axillary fascicle. Ovules 1 per locule of ovary. Seed sometimes carunculate, sometimes arillate.\r",
      "About 322 genera and 8910 species: widespread throughout the world, primarily in the tropics and subtropics, more poorly represented in temperate regions; 75 genera (one endemic, nine introduced) and 406 species (99 endemic, 27 introduced) in China, nearly 95% of which are found in the S and SW parts of the country.Fifty-nine genera and over 1700 species: mostly tropical, the greatest diversity in SE Asia; 16 genera and 138 species (41 endemic, four introduced) in China.Four genera and ca. 210 species: throughout the tropics; two genera and 13 species (three endemic) in China.Two hundred and eighteen genera and over 5700 species: widespread throughout the world, primarily in the tropics and subtropics, more poorly represented in temperate regions; 54 genera (one endemic, nine introduced) and 255 species (55 endemic, 23 introduced) in China.",
      "The Euphorbiaceae as treated here include the following families that have been proposed for segregation: Androstachydaceae, Antidesmataceae, Bischofiaceae, Hymenocardiaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Pedilanthaceae, Picrodendraceae, Porantheraceae, Putranjivaceae, Ricinocarpaceae, Scepaceae, Stilaginaceae, Trewiaceae, and Uapacaceae. The Pandaceae and Buxaceae, formerly included here, are now well established as separate families.Molecular data has shown that the traditional concept of Euphorbiaceae includes three major lineages that are relatively distantly related to each other: the Phyllanthoids (genera 1-16 in this account), the Putranjivoids (genera 17 and 18), and the Euphorbioids (genera 19-75).Many species of Euphorbiaceae are of economic importance, probably most importantly as the main source of rubber (Hevea) but also as sources of medicine; foods, both as a staple starch source (Manihot) and fruits (e.g., Phyllanthus emblica); seed oils (Ricinus, Vernicia); and insecticides.Li Pingt\u2019ao. 1994. Euphorbiaceae. In: Li Pingt\u2019ao, ed., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 44(1): ii-viii, 1-217; Kiu Huashing, Hwang Shumei & Chang Yongtian. 1996. Euphorbiaceae (2). In: Kiu Huashing, ed., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 44(2): ii-ix, 1-212; Ma Jinshuang & Tseng Yungchien. 1997. Euphorbiaceae (3). In: Ma Jinshuang, ed., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 44(3): ii-vi, 1-150.The Putranjivoid genera resemble phyllanthoids by their 2-ranked leaves, frequently rather small fasciculate flowers, and ovules 2 per locule. They can be distinguished by their leaf blades, stigmas, and fruit. Also, the leaves contain mustard oils and so frequently taste peppery when fresh, although the taste may take a little time to develop.",
      "Ovules 1 per locule; indumentum of simple, stellate, scalelike, glandular, or stinging hairs; latex present or absent; leaves mostly spiral, less often distichous, blade sometimes lobed (palmately compound in Hevea), margin entire or variously toothed, often with glands\/extra-floral nectaries on petiole apex\/leaf base and\/or margins; inflorescence axillary or terminal, often thyrsoid or cymose, sometimes pseudanthial, rarely sessile clusters; seeds sometimes carunculate. .....

      "Baas et al. (Grana 18: 69-89. 1979) provided two interpretations of the perianth, one similar to the above (although with petals (3 or)4(or 5)) and another in which the inner whorl is regarded as a calyx, the outer whorl as bracteoles or an epicalyx, and the corolla consequently absent.In their detailed review, Baas et al. (loc. cit.) were unable to place Plagiopteron with any confidence and concluded that the genus deserved family rank, following Airy Shaw\u2019s earlier concept (Kew Bull. 18: 249-273. 1965). The molecular evidence presented in abstract by Simmons et al. (Amer. J. Bot. 87(6, Abstracts): 156-157. 2000) placed Plagiopteron clearly in the Celastraceae, close to the Hippocrateoid genera. Savolainen et al. (Kew Bull. 55: 257-306. 2000) and Soltis et al. (Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 133: 381-461. 2000) similarly placed the genus. The general appearance of the plant, a woody climber with fairly large opposite leaves, small flowers in many-flowered terminal cymes, and fruit with Acer-like wings supports this affinity. Further similarities were found in the elastic material of the leaf midrib vascular cylinder. The pollen of Plagiopteron is apparently unusual for Celastraceae (Baas et al., loc. cit.).Chang Hung-ta. 1989. Plagiopteron. In: Chang Hung-ta, ed., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 49(1): 48-50."

      "Oil glands of Rutaceae, when viewed from the surface of plant parts they occupy, are usually pellucid. They also appear to be \u00b1 isodiametric and to have \u00b1 definite patterns of distribution. In blades of leaves, for example, where they are most commonly observed, they are usually \u00b1 evenly scattered throughout, or sometimes they are restricted to the margins. Rarely they are alleged to occur only along the secondary veins of the blades.In a cladistic analysis of selected genera of Rutaceae and related families based on rbcL and atpB molecular data (but only on rbcL data for Harrisonia), M. W. Chase, C. M. Morton, and J. A. Kallunki (Amer. J. Bot. 86: 1191-1199. 1999) recommended the placement of Harrisonia (traditionally Simaroubaceae) in Rutaceae. We do not agree with this classification, particularly because Harrisonia appears to lack oil glands, and suggest that the genus is most correctly placed in Cneoraceae, in which it is treated herein.Several taxa of cultivated Rutaceae treated by C.

      "Molecular studies have shown that the members of the Bombacaceae, Malvaceae, Sterculiaceae, and Tiliaceae form a very well-defined monophyletic group that is divided into ten also rather well-defined clades, only two of which correspond to the traditional families Bombacaceae and Malvaceae. Some of the remaining groups are included entirely within either of the remaining families but others cut across the traditional divide between the Sterculiaceae and Tiliaceae. A majority of authors, most notably Bayer and Kubitzki (Fam. Gen. Vasc. Pl. 5: 225-311. 2003), has favored including everything within a greatly enlarged Malvaceae, and treating the individual clades as subfamilies. The alternative view is that the individual clades should be treated as a series of ten families: Bombacaceae (Bombacoideae), Brownlowiaceae (Brownlowioideae), Byttneriaceae (Byttnerioideae), Durionaceae (Durionoideae), Helicteraceae (Helicteroideae), Malvaceae (Malvoideae), Pentapetaceae (Dombeyoideae), Sparrmanniaceae (Grewioideae), Sterculiaceae (Sterculioideae), and Tiliaceae (Tilioideae) (Cheek in Heywood et al., Fl. Pl. Fam. World. 201-202. 2007). For the present treatment, we prefer to retain the familiar, traditional four families, so as to maintain continuity with the treatments in FRPS, and to await a consensus on the two alternative strategies for dealing with the very widely accepted clades.The traditional Malvaceae coincides exactly with one of the major clades. The only possible problem is the relationship with the Bombacaceae, which also has primarily 1-loculed anthers, and some authorities have suggested that the Bombacaceae should be included within the Malvaceae.Members of the Malvaceae are important as fiber crops (particularly cotton, Gossypium). Young leaves of many species can be used as vegetables, and species of Abelmoschus and Hibiscus are grown as minor food crops. Many species have attractive flowers and an ever-increasing selection is grown as ornamentals. Several have been cultivated for a very long time, particularly species of Hibiscus, and some of these are not known in the wild.Feng Kuo-mei. 1984. Malvaceae. In: Feng Kuo-mei, ed., Fl. Reipubl.

      "Former classifications usually placed Rhamnaceae in the Rhamnales, together with Vitaceae and Leeaceae (Suessenguth in Engler & Prantl, Nat. Pflanzenfam., ed. 2, 20d. 1953), or together with Elaeagnaceae (Thorne, Bot. Rev. 58: 225-348. 1992). Orders such as Celastrales, Urticales, and Euphorbiales have often been considered as closely related groups. Recent analyses of DNA sequences strongly supported including the family in the Rosales, beside the closest relatives Barbeyaceae and Dirachmaceae (see Angiosperm Phylogeny Group II, Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 141: 399-436. 2003). Suessenguth (loc. cit.) grouped the family into five tribes, mainly characterized by fruit characters. Richardson et al. (Kew Bull. 55: 311-340. 2000; Amer. J. Bot. 87: 1309-1324. 2000) revised this tribal classification on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis using rbcL and trnL-F sequences of the plastid genome. Now 11 tribes are recognized, of which four are represented in the Flora area.Microrhamnus bodinieri H. L\u00e9veill\u00e9 (Fl. Kouy-Tch\u00e9ou, 341. 1914-1915) is a synonym of Nyssa sinensis Oliver in the Nyssaceae (see Fl. China 13: 302. 2007).The bark, leaves, and fruit of several species of Rhamnus have been used as laxatives, notably R. cathartica and R. frangula. Diverse Old World species of Rhamnus provide yellow and green dyes as well as drugs. Timber of Alphitonia, Colubrina, Hovenia, and Ziziphus species is used for construction, fine furniture, carving, lathework, and musical instruments. Many Ziziphus species yield edible fruit; among them, Z. jujuba (Chinese jujube) and Z. mauritiana (Indian jujube) are cultivated on a commercial scale. Hovenia dulcis is also grown for its edible, fleshy inflorescence stalks. Species of Hovenia, Paliurus, and Rhamnus are cultivated as ornamentals.Chen Yi-ling & Chou Pan-kai. 1982. Rhamnaceae.

      "There is some variation in the circumscription of Sapindaceae in taxonomic treatments, particularly with regard to the inclusion of genera from the closely related, predominately temperate families Aceraceae and Hippocastanaceae. Several studies including M\u00fcller and Leenhouts (in Ferguson & M\u00fcller, Evolutionary Significance Exine: 407-445. 1976), and more recently those based on molecular data (Stevens, Angiosperm Phylogeny Website, 2001 onward; Harrington et al., Syst. Bot. 30: 366-382. 2005), supported the recognition of a broadly defined Sapindaceae incorporating Aceraceae and Hippocastanaceae. Harrington et al. (loc. cit.) proposed four subfamilies or clades, comprising Sapindoideae (including Koelreuteria and Ungnadia Endlicher), Dodonaeoideae, Hippocastanoideae (including taxa previously referred to Aceraceae and Hippocastanaceae, plus Handeliodendron), and a monotypic \"Xanthoceratoideae\". Within Hippocastanoideae, Acer Linnaeus and Dipteronia Oliver comprise a monophyletic group and are treated in this Flora as Aceraceae. Similarly, Aesculus Linnaeus, Billia Peyritsch, and the Chinese endemic Handeliodendron Rehder form a monophyletic group and are treated here as Hippocastanaceae. There is some support for \"Xanthoceratoideae\" being the first lineage to diverge within the broadly defined Sapindaceae assemblage; consequently, Xanthoceras is treated separately from genera in Sapindoideae and Dodonaeoideae in the following account of Sapindaceae s.s. The sequence of genera reflects M\u00fcller and Leenhouts (loc. cit.) as modified by recent analyses based on molecular and morphological data, rather than following the order developed by Radlkofer (Sitzungsber. Math.-Phys. Cl. K\u00f6nigl. Bayer. Akad. Wiss. M\u00fcnchen 20: 105-379. 1890; and in Engler, Pflanzenreich 98a-h(IV. 165): 1-1539. 1931-1934), which was previously followed in FRPS.The main economic uses of this family include (1) timber: Amesiodendron chinense, Dimocarpus longan, D. confinis, Litchi chinensis, Pavieasia kwangsiensis, and Pometia pinnata; (2) fruit: Dimocarpus longan, Litchi chinensis, and Nephelium lappaceum; (3) medicine: Dimocarpus longan (arillode), Litchi chinensis (seeds), and Sapindus saponaria (roots); (4) oil: Amesiodendron chinense, Delavaya toxocarpa, and Xanthoceras sorbifolium. Saponins occur widely in the family, commonly used as a fish poison and for their detergent properties.Lo Hsien-shui & Chen Te-chao. 1985. Sapindaceae (excluding Handeliodendron).

      "From the morphological standpoint, the Lythraceae sensu lato (including Trapaceae) have a very generalized morphology, without a single unique, defining character, i.e., there is no morphological synapomorphy that defines the family. At the same time, the genera are distinct. The position of the ovary in Duabanga, Punica, Sonneratia, and Trapa is variable: superior to partly inferior in Sonneratia; partly inferior in Duabanga; and partly, nearly, or completely inferior in Punica and Trapa. Several other features ally these genera to the Lythraceae sensu stricto, including opposite and simple leaves, commonly held wood anatomical characters (true for the Myrtales generally), development of a persistent floral tube, valvate sepals, 4- or 6-merous flowers, introrse and versatile anthers, axile placentation, and seeds without endosperm. Of the four genera, Trapa is the most divergent, but still sufficiently similar to the Lythraceae and Onagraceae to have been considered for membership within either family, or as a closely related family (as has been done in the present Flora). The inclusion of Sonneratia, Duabanga, and Punica in the Lythraceae adds some additional derived features to the definition of the family, but at the same time, brings together taxa that we know, from molecular sequence data, represent a single historical lineage. That knowledge of evolutionary relationship is lost if the genera are maintained as separate families, whereas the taxonomic utility of the Flora is not affected by their inclusion in an expanded Lythraceae.The molecular data from four genes (three chloroplast and one nuclear) unquestionably place not only Duabanga, Punica, and Sonneratia, but also Trapa, within the Lythraceae. Punica is well supported as a member of a clade of genera that includes Capuronia Lourteig, Galpinia N. E. Brown, and Pemphis (from East Africa and Madagascar). Duabanga and Lagerstroemia are sister genera, and Sonneratia and Trapa, as unlikely as it may seem morphologically, are also sister genera. Duabanga, Lagerstroemia, Sonneratia, and Trapa together form one of seven clades in the family.In addition to the species described below, several species have been recorded as introduced or cultivated in China. Cuphea carthagenensis (Jacquin) J. F. Macbride (C. balsamona Chamisso & Schlechtendal), of South American origin, is an introduced weed in many places in the Pacific, although it has never been cultivated. Cuphea viscosissima Jacquin (C. petiolata (Linnaeus) Koehne 1882, not Pohl ex Koehne 1877), native to the E United States, has never been cultivated but misidentifications of cultivated C. lanceolata in botanical gardens as C. viscosissima (or C. petiolata) have put its name in records of cultivated plants. Several other species have been recorded as cultivated in China, including C. hookeriana Walpers, C. hyssopifolia Kunth, C. ignea A. Candolle (C. platycentra Lemaire, 1846, not Bentham, 1839), C. lanceolata W. T. Aiton, C. micropetala Kunth, and C. procumbens Ortega, as well as Heimia myrtifolia Chamisso & Schlechtendal, Lafoensia vandelliana Chamisso & Schlechtendal, and Lawsonia inermis Linnaeus. Of these, however, only C. hyssopifolia, C. ignea, and L. inermis (henna) are really widely grown as ornamentals.Lee Shu-kang & Lau Lan-fang; Ko Wan-chueng; Lo Hsien-shui. 1983.

Therefore, two families are recognized here: Datiscaceae, comprising Datisca only, and Tetramelaceae, comprising the other two genera. Zhang et al. (Molec. Phylogen. Evol. 39: 305-322. 2006) placed Tetramelaceae as sister to Datiscaceae + Begoniaceae, although the latter clade had less than 50% support. The same authors placed Tetramelaceae + Datiscaceae + Begoniaceae as sister to Cucurbitaceae.Datisca comprises two species: D. glomerata (C. Presl) Baillon, from W North America, and D. cannabina Linnaeus (including D. nepalensis D. Don). Datisca cannabina is a large, perennial, dioecious herb with pinnate leaves, and is distributed from the E Mediterranean (Crete) to the Himalayas, including countries adjoining W China from Kazakhstan to Nepal. It grows in moist places, often by streams in forests, and might yet be found in SW Xinjiang or SW Xizang.Li Yanhui. 1999. Tetramelaceae. In: Ku Tsuechih, ed., Fl. Reipubl.

      "Although many members of this family have distinctive vegetative and floral features, providing a useful key to identify the many genera in China presents several difficulties. First, the classification of genera and generic groupings has been largely based on the morphology and anatomy of the fruit. Thus, to construct a \u201cgood\u201d dichotomous key with equal leads, rather than \u201cchipping off\u201d individual genera using unique characteristics, the use of fruit macro- and microscopic characters is unavoidable. This is even more acute when dealing with large numbers of genera. Another major problem is that several of the large genera are heterogeneous, with diffuse generic boundaries and broad patterns of variation. To try and cope with these difficulties two types of identification tool are presented here. The first is a dichotomous key that emphasizes the traditional fruit characters, and the second is a multi-access key that allows easy comparison of ten characteristics across all genera. The multi-access key is particularly useful for incomplete material, but it is worth stressing that specimens without at least developing fruit are usually very difficult to identify.\r",

      "The following dichotomous key reflects the traditional classification of the genera of the Apiaceae into subfamilies, tribes, and subtribes. This classification relies heavily on characters of fruit morphology and anatomy, many of which are subject to convergent evolution (e.g., for fruit dispersal strategies). The long-held understanding that this gives rise to artificial, heterogeneous assemblages has been verified by recent molecular studies of DNA sequences. For this reason tribes and subtribes are not formally recognized in the following account; however, they are indicated in the dichotomous key and the traditional order of genera is largely retained. It is worth noting that the generic grouping within the three subfamilies is well supported by molecular evidence, the exception being Hydrocotyle and Centella which are most likely derived, herbaceous members of the Araliaceae and not Hydrocotyloideae (the residue of this subfamily is restricted to the S hemisphere).",

      "The family is treated here in the strict sense, excluding Alangium (Alangiaceae), Aucuba (Aucubaceae), Davidia (Davidiaceae), Helwingia (Helwingiaceae), Mastixia (Mastixiaceae), Nyssa (Nyssaceae), and Toricellia (Toricelliaceae), all of which have sometimes been placed in the Cornaceae. The Cornaceae in the FRPS included Mastixia, Cornus sensu lato, Aucuba, Helwingia, and Toricellia. Given that the latter three genera are allied with higher asterids in broad phylogenetic analyses, they are, therefore, removed from the Cornaceae in this treatment. These genera are recognized in the present volume as three families following Takhtajan (Sist. Magnoliofit. 1987). Based on molecular data, Mastixia is a close relative, but not the sister of, Cornus. Its relationships to Cornus and close relatives remain unclear. Thus, we also treat Mastixia as a family separate from Cornaceae. Although molecular data have suggested that Alangium is a member of Cornaceae, the genus will be treated as a separate family in a different volume of the Flora of China. This treatment of Cornaceae therefore includes only Cornus sensu lato.\r",
      "The circumscription of the Cornaceae and the relationships among the 17 genera often placed within it have been controversial. The family has been defined as consisting of a single genus, Cornus, or up to as many as 15 genera by various authors (e.g., Harms, Ber. Deutsch. Bot. Ges. 15: 19\u201329. 1898; Takhtajan, Sist. Magnoliofit. 1987; Cronquist, Integr. Syst. Classif. Fl. Pl. 1988; Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard. 85: 531\u2013553. 1998; see also Xiang et al., Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard. 80: 723\u2013734. 1993; Xiang & Soltis in Boufford & Ohba, Sino-Jap. Fl. Charact. Diversif. 123. 1998). Recent phylogenetic analyses of the chloroplast gene rbcL sequences (Xiang et al., loc. cit. 1993; Xiang & Soltis, loc. cit. 1998; Xiang, Harvard Pap. Bot. 4: 527\u2013542. 1999) suggested that nine genera (Aralidium, Aucuba, Corokia, Garrya, Griselinia, Helwingia, Kaliphora, Melanophylla, and Toricellia) were not closely related to Cornaceae. Evidence from other studies, including pollen morphology and wood anatomy (Li & Chao, Quart. J. Taiwan Mus. 7: 119\u2013136. 1954; Ferguson & Hideux, Proc. IV Int. Palynol. Conf., Lucknow 1: 240. 1980; Noshiro & Baas, IAWA J. 19: 43\u201397. 1998; see also Eyde, Bot. Rev. 54: 233\u2013351. 1988), support the removal of these genera from Cornaceae. Various phylogenetic analyses of the rbcL and other chloroplast gene sequences identified a strongly supported monophyletic Cornales consisting of Alangium, Camptotheca, Cornus, Curtisia, Davidia, Diplopanax, Hydrangeaceae, Hydrostachyaceae, Grubbiaceae, Loasaceae, Mastixia, and Nyssa (Chase et al., Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard. 80: 528\u2013580. 1993; Xiang & Soltis, loc. cit. 1998; Xiang, loc. cit. 1999; Olmstead et al., Molec. Phylogen.

Phylogenetic analyses of the rbcL and matK sequences for the Cornales suggested a Cornaceae consisting of Alangium and Cornus, a Grubbiaceae consisting of Curtisia and Grubbia (Xiang et al., Amer. J. Bot. 85: 285\u2013297. 1998; Xiang, loc. cit. 1999; Xiang et al., Molec. Phylogen. Evol. 24: 35\u201357. 2002; Fan & Xiang, Amer. J. Bot. 90: 1357\u20131372. 2003). The Cornaceae of Eyde (loc. cit. 1988), consisting of Camptotheca, Cornus, Davidia, Diplopanax, Mastixia, and Nyssa, were not supported by molecular data.\r",

      "The Monotropoideae are here included in the Ericaceae; previously in FRPS (56: 157\u2013216. 1990), they were treated as the Pyrolaceae. Chiogenes, recorded from China in FRPS (57(3): 69\u201371. 1991), is here included in Gaultheria. Over the last half century, the Empetraceae have usually been separated from, but closely associated with, the Ericaceae. In their ecology, leaf morphology and insertion, rusts, embryology, stamen anatomy, etc., they largely agree with that family. Molecular data place Empetrum and its relatives firmly within the Ericaceae, and in particular within the subfamily Ericoideae, in agreement with phytochemical and palynological data, and there they are best recognized as a separate tribe. There are distinctive features of the Empetreae that were responsible for their past familial status, e.g., reduced perianth with separate members, low ovule number, enlarged stigmas, etc. However, these are likely to be derived features associated with wind pollination. See Kron et al. (Bot. Rev. 68: 335\u2013423. 2002) and the recent treatment of the Ericaceae by Stevens et al. (in Kubitzki, Fam. Gen. Vasc. Pl. 6: 145\u2013194. 2004).\r",

      "A few foreign well-known ornamental species are cultivated in China, including the florist's gloxinia, Sinningia speciosa (Loddiges) Hiern, and African violet, Saintpaulia ionantha Wendland. The two ovary carpels may each produce a stigma; these stigmas are fused into a single structure. Some students of Gesneriaceae have considered the stigma to be single and either simple (capitate) or 2-lobed, whereas others consider each of the two stigmas as units. We have maintained the latter usage, but a family-wide investigation of stigma development is needed. The distinction can be blurred, however, because the stigmas may be completely fused into one with a capitate apex (as in Didymocarpus) or one of the two carpels or stigmas may be aborted resulting in a single stigma that may or may not be 2-lobed. Certain characters used in this treatment require some explanation. Disc shape is frequently described as \"ringlike,\" \"cupular,\" or rarely \"tubular\"; ringlike describes a disc that is shorter than or equalling its diameter, and cupular describes one that is longer than its diameter. Tubular describes a disc which is at least twice as long as wide. The corolla tube diameter measurement is for the widest part, usually the mouth. Wang Wentsai, Pan Kaiyu, & Li Zhenyu. 1990.

      "The flowers often open before the petals have fully expanded making it easy to underestimate floral dimensions.One of the major studies of the Annonaceae of tropical Asia was by Suzanne Jovet-Ast (1914-2006), who published an account of the Indochinese species under her maiden name, Ast (Fl. Indo-Chine, Suppl. 1: 62-121. 1938). Unfortunately, she failed to provide Latin descriptions for her many new taxa, none of the names of which was therefore validly published. Her new combinations were validly published, however, and she did subsequently validate a few species of Goniothalamus under her maiden name; but she did not validate most of her new species until after she married and took up the name \"Jovet-Ast.\" These later names form the major part of all her publications, so we have chosen to cite her as \"Jovet-Ast [\"Ast\"]\" for those taxa validated under her maiden name.Tsiang Ying & Li Ping-t\u2019ao. 1979.

However, a problem with the treatment of Berberis necessitated postponing publication of the family until the present volume. See the comments under Berberis, below.The family Berberidaceae presents an interesting, distinctive biogeography. The two species of Achlys Candolle are disjunctly distributed between E Asia and North America, with one in Japan and Korea and one along the west coast of North America. Caulophyllum and Diphylleia each contain three species; the former has one species in E Asia and two in North America, the latter has two in E Asia and one in North America. Sinopodophyllum and Plagiorhegma (if maintained separate from Podophyllum Linnaeus and Jeffersonia Barton, respectively) are endemic to E Asia, but their closest relatives, Podophyllum and Jeffersonia, are widely disjunct in E North America. Epimedium has a wide, fragmented range from Japan westward to Algeria; the nearest relative, Vancouveria C. Morren & Decaisne, is endemic to the Pacific Northwest of North America. Dysosma and Nandina are endemic to China, and Ranzania T. Ito is endemic to Japan.Podophyllum cavaleriei H. L\u00e9veill\u00e9 (Bull. Acad. Int. G\u00e9ogr.

      "Two of us (Lammers and Klein) do not agree with the separation of Leptocodon and Campanumoea from Codonopsis in this treatment. We consider that the single character used in each case, five lamellar glands alternate with the stamens in Leptocodon and baccate fruit in Campanumoea, is not sufficient to justify recognition of a distinct genus. We regard these two genera as embedded within Codonopsis, as was done by Lammers (in C. I. Peng, Phytogeogr. Bot. Invent. Taiwan, 43-61. 1992), Morris and Lammers (Bot. Bull. Acad. Sin. 38: 277-284. 1997), Lammers (in T. C. Huang, Fl. Taiwan, ed. 2, 4: 775-802. 1998), Lammers (in Kubitzki [Kadereit & Jeffrey], Fam. Gen. Vasc. Pl. 8: 26-56. 2007), and Lammers (World Checkl. Bibliogr. Campanulaceae. 262-273. 2007). On the other hand, one of us (Hong) notes that two characters distinguish Leptocodon from Codonopsis. One is the five lamellar glands and the other is the shape of the stigma segments, which are clavate in Leptocodon but orbicular-deltoid in Codonopsis. Campanumoea differs from Codonopsis not only in having baccate fruit but also in its pollen, which is shortly 5-colpate (vs. 5-8-long-colpate in the core group of Codonopsis). Campanumoea is not a very distinct genus, and it seems that it would be equally reasonable to sink it into Codonopsis or to separate it. However, if it were sunk, then it would also be reasonable to sink Adenophora into Campanula because the former genus differs from the latter only in having a nectar disk around the style.Pentaphragma Wallich ex G. Don and Sphenoclea Gaertner were included in Campanulaceae in FRPS but are treated in this volume as Pentaphragmataceae and Sphenocleaceae, respectively.

      "This is one of the largest families of flowering plants and is represented nearly worldwide though it is most abundant in the tropical regions of both hemispheres. Important economic members of the family are coffee (Coffea), quinine (Cinchona), madder (Rubia), ipecac (Carapichea Aublet), and various horticultural plants, notably Gardenia, Ixora, Mussaenda, and Pentas. Several genera include pantropical weeds, notably Mitracarpus, Richardia, and Spermacoce, of neotropical origin, and Oldenlandia (Hedyotis) of African origin. A number of species are used for various medicinal purposes.Genera, tribes, and subfamilies of Rubiaceae characteristically either have or lack raphides; this character is generally considered informative taxonomically in this family. Raphides are tiny, needle-shaped crystals that are produced in groups inside some cells of leaf, stem, flower, and fruit tissues. They apparently function to protect the plant from herbivores. Raphides are often visible with a hand lens on dried specimens, particularly in soft tissues such as petals, the calyx hypanthium, and the young leaves at the apex of the stem, but may be difficult to see especially in succulent plants.Leaf domatia are common in Rubiaceae and are sometimes taxonomically informative at least for separation of species. These domatia provide protection for tiny mites that live on the leaves and that help protect the plant from herbivores and fungi by eating insect eggs, small insects, and spores. These domatia occasionally take the form of foveolae or crypts, but more often are formed by small groups or tufts of pubescence, which is sometimes different in form from pubescence found on other parts of the plant.At least half of the species of Rubiaceae have distylous flowers: an individual species has two flower forms, the long-styled form (or pin) with the stigmas borne above the anthers and the short-styled form (or thrum) with the anthers borne above the stigmas. An individual plant bears only one flower form, and the flowers are incompatible with other flowers of similar form whether borne on the same or another plant. Heterostyly is unusual in the flowering plants and is found in several other plant families that mostly have three floral forms instead of two with the third form (the homostylous) with the stigmas and anthers borne at the same level. Tristyly has only been documented very rarely for Rubiaceae, although it was noted by FRPS for Chassalia curviflora in China.A number of species of many genera of Rubiaceae have calyx lobes that are unequal in size on an individual flower, and in some species of several genera one or more of the calyx lobes are markedly different, much enlarged and also often petaloid. These structures are found on flowers, where they are typically brightly colored and apparently function to attract pollinators, and\/or on the fruit, where they are dry and brown and apparently function in dispersal of the fruit or seeds. These structures have variously been called \"petaloid calyx lobes,\" a morphologically descriptive term; \"semaphylls,\" a term that refers to the assumed function in pollination; and \"calycophylls,\" the term used here that refers to the leaflike shape of the calyx lobe. These structures are sometimes mistaken for bracts; a few species of Rubiaceae do also have petaloid bracts (e.g., Dunnia), but those structures are inserted on the inflorescence axes or immediately below the ovary of the flower.The woody Rubiaceae are better represented (i.e., more diverse) in moist temperate regions of China than in comparable habitats in North America, as detailed by Latham and Ricklefs (in Ricklefs & Schluter, Spec. Diversity Ecol. Communities, 294-314. 1993). They concluded that this pattern, which is also found in a number of other dicotyledonous families, is due largely to historical factors. The principal factors they identified are the extinction of woody Rubiaceae in these other regions, while the plants were able to persist in E Asia (e.g., Emmenopterys), and the long-term direct connection of the moist temperate and moist tropical zones in E Asia vs. the separation of these zones by deserts and large water bodies in other regions. They agreed with Wolfe (in Nelson & Rosen, Vicariance Biogeogr. 413-427. 1981) that the connections of plant ranges between E North America and E Asia were broken by the end of the Eocene, and thus that species of the several genera that are found in both regions (e.g., Cephalanthus) have had separate evolutionary histories for some time. Several SE Asian Rubiaceae genera, all found in China, appear to represent the most basal living lineages of the family, notably Acranthera, Coptosapelta, and Luculia (Bremer et al., Syst. Biol. 48: 413-435. 1999; Bremer & Manen, Pl. Syst. Evol. 225: 43-72. 2000; Rydin et al., Pl. Syst. Evol. 278: 101-123. 2009).A number of species of Rubiaceae are cultivated as ornamentals; most of these are mentioned and some are keyed and described here.Additional information on many of the cultivated Rubiaceae was presented by Puff and Chamchumroon (Thai Forest Bull., Bot. 31: 75-94. 2003).Complete Rubiaceae floras for E Asia are very few. The Chinese Rubiaceae were treated comprehensively in 1999 by FRPS; the treatment here is based primarily on that work. The Fl. URSS was published in English in 2000, but this is an unedited, unmodified translation of the 1958 work. The Fl. Japan has been published in several editions but includes relatively few genera and is rather idiosyncratic. The genus overview within the Rubiaceae of Thailand: A Pictorial Guide to Indigenous and Cultivated Genera by Puff et al. (43-240. 2005) is a useful recent reference.Some morphological features that are characteristic of the Rubiaceae have been described, measured, and named very differently by different authors, and the differing terminology has generated some confusion. In particular, the terminology and measurements used for the calyx and gynoecium have differed widely. The ovary of Rubiaceae flowers is typically inferior, and the calyx is gamosepalous with its free portion, or limb, arising from the top of the ovary portion; this limb varies from reduced (i.e., not developed) to developed, and truncate to deeply lobed. Most Rubiaceae authors have distinguished the inferior ovary portion of the flower from the free calyx limb; the ovary portion has sometimes been called simply an ovary, but sometimes considered to include the fused calyx and corolla tissue covering it and called a hypanthium. However, several authors, including in FRPS, have treated as one structure the inferior ovary together with the unlobed lower portion of the calyx limb, when this is present, as the \"calyx tube\" and the lobed portion of the calyx as a separate structure, the calyx lobes. The \"calyx tube\" is often clearly delimited and measurable, but the inclusion of the ovary in this means that this measurement can sometimes include ovaries that have been fertilized and are developing into fruit, thus are larger than and not comparable to the ovaries at anthesis even though the corolla may be still attached to the flowers. Here the ovary or hypanthium portion of the flower is measured separately from the limb; the term \"hypanthium\" is used to link these measurements to those of FRPS. The limb is measured separately here because the length of the tubular portion of this often includes taxonomically useful information, and while the \"calyx tube\" measurement is lost when the fruit are developed, the length of the tubular portion of the free calyx limb is usually still evident on the fruit thus facilitating identification. Another portion of the gynoecium that has been regarded differently by different authors is the distinction between the stigma and style: the structures regarded as 2-lobed stigmas by some authors are regarded as a style with 2 separate stigmas by as many other authors. Morphological study of the androecium and gynoecium here during preparation of a flora treatment has not been detailed and no focused effort has been made here to systematize these morphological interpretations.Inflorescence terminology is complicated in most flowering plant families. The terms \"bract\" and \"bracteole\" have been carefully and regularly applied by some Rubiaceae authors, with the term \"bracteole\" used only for the bracts that immediately subtend the flowers or in some cases that are found anywhere along the pedicels, and the term \"bract\" used for the remaining structures. However, other authors have not distinguished these structures, or have not distinguished them regularly or consistently. The term \"floral bract\" here refers to the structures found on the pedicels or that immediately subtend sessile flowers. Bracts and leaves are generally considered homologous structures, and in Rubiaceae these often vary continuously along the inflorescences. In particular, Rubiaceae commonly have somewhat reduced leaves subtending the inflorescences, and bracts that are somewhat enlarged and occasionally leaflike. These structures have been variously called \"reduced leaves\" or \"foliose bracts\" or \"foliaceous bracts\" (here called \"leaflike bracts\"). In particular, many species with branched inflorescences sometimes have rather large, leaflike bracts subtending the basalmost pair of secondary axes; these have been various interpreted as enlarged bracts at the top of the peduncle, or vegetative leaves that are borne at the base of a sessile, tripartite inflorescence.Significant measurements found on plants from outside China are noted in the discussions following the species descriptions and\/or are included within brackets in the descriptions in accordance with Flora of China style. Authors in FRPS described the seeds and embryos of some Rubiaceae but not others; their descriptions are reported. In many cases no information is available about these features for Chinese Rubiaceae. Authors in FRPS also described the pollen of a few genera; these reports are not included here because a number of very detailed, extensively documented pollen descriptions are available elsewhere, which show that much variation is found in pollen morphology at the species level in Rubiaceae and as yet Rubiaceae genera are not well characterized in terms of pollen. Thus, the very limited information available only at the genus level here does not seem well integrated into this flora treatment. The counts presented here for leaf veins apply to the secondary veins, as done by the majority of Rubiaceae authors. Many species of Rubiaceae also frequently have rather well-developed though shorter intersecondary veins, which often vary widely in number and degree of development between populations or plants; these apparently were occasionally combined with the secondary veins in the measurements given by FRPS, but such measurements are subject to significant misinterpretation by authors working in other regions and the varied usage in that work adds yet more confusion.Where data were missing from the descriptions in the first draft for the Flora of China, the terms \"unknown,\" \"not known,\" \"not noted,\" and \"not seen\" were retained (with \"not known\" consisted to \"unknown\"). Where these terms were used in the habitats and elevational ranges they were deleted in accordance with the style of previous Flora of China volumes. Where missing data were denoted with question marks, e.g., \"shape??,\" or with constructions such as \"__ \u00d7 __ ,\" these were deleted because it was not apparent which of the above categories of missing data applied.The genus Khasiaclunea Ridsdale (Blumea 24: 347. 1979) is known with certainty from India and Myanmar and provisionally from N Vietnam; this may also be present in China, but no confidently determined specimens have yet been seen. The single species, K. oligocephala (Haviland) Ridsdale (Blumea 24: 347. 1979; Adina oligocephala Haviland, J. Linn. Soc., Bot. 33: 46. 1897), was reported by Ridsdale (loc. cit.) as \"probably\" found in China; however, this genus is not treated here.Lo Hsienshui, Ko Wancheung, Chen Weichiu, Hsue Hsianghao & Wu Hen. 1999.

      "Taxonomic discussion on the Asteraceae is included under the relevant tribes. The following notes apply to the whole family. Modes of reproduction in the Chinese Asteraceae are known only fragmentarily. As regards the world diversity of the family, only about 12% of genera have been studied using cytoembryology to identify the reproduction system. In 3%, agamospermy was found to occur. Probably the most common reproduction system is allogamy with a sporophytic self-incompatibility; occasional selfing is also possible (stigma ageing or mentor effect). More or less obligate autogamy is relatively rare. Other uncommon reproduction systems include gynodioecy, a very rare dioecy (with heterogametic females). Asexual reproduction is a widespread phenomenon in the Asteraceae, with a wide range of mechanisms. In addition to the rare adventitious embryony, there are common types of autonomous apomixis, agamospermy (apospory, diplospory) associated with various forms of embryogenesis (parthenogenesis, apogamety). All the types of reproduction are to be considered in the evaluation of population variation and for taxonomic conclusions because the prevailing type of reproduction substantially influences the variation limits of taxa.Ling Yong, Chen Yi-ling, Shih Chu, Chen Feng-hwai, Chang Chao-chien, Tseng Yong-qian, Hu Chi-ming & Huang Xiu-lan. 1979.

Flowering stems (culms) jointed, internodes hollow or solid; branches arising singly from nodes and subtended by a leaf sheath and 2-keeled prophyll, often fascicled in bamboos. Leaves arranged alternately in 2 ranks, differentiated into sheath, blade, and an adaxial erect appendage at sheath\/blade junction (ligule); leaf sheath surrounding and supporting culm-internode, split to base or infrequently tubular with partially or completely fused margins, modified with reduced blade in bamboos (culm sheaths); leaf blades divergent, usually long, narrow and flat, but varying from inrolled and filiform to ovate, veins parallel, sometimes with cross-connecting veinlets (especially in bamboos); ligule membranous or a line of hairs. Inflorescence terminal or axillary, an open, contracted, or spikelike panicle, or composed of lax to spikelike racemes arranged along an elongate central axis, or digitate, paired, or occasionally solitary; axillary inflorescences often many, subtended by spatheoles (specialized bladeless leaf sheaths) and gathered into a leafy compound panicle; spikelets often aggregated into complex clusters in bamboos. Spikelets composed of distichous bracts arranged along a slender axis (rachilla); typically 2 lowest bracts (glumes) empty, subtending 1 to many florets; glumes often poorly differentiated from accompanying bracts in bamboos. Florets composed of 2 opposing bracts enclosing a single small flower, outer bract (lemma) clasping the more delicate, usually 2-keeled inner bract (palea); base of floret often with thickened prolongation articulated with rachilla (callus); lemma often with apical or dorsal bristle (awn), glumes also sometimes awned.

      "Grasses are present throughout China, but the largest area of natural grassland lies in the northern part of the country, forming part of the temperate Eurasian steppe. Much of this area has now been converted from rangeland into farmland with wheat (Triticum) as the major food crop. The moister grasslands of northeast China support forest steppe, the dominant natural grasses being Leymus chinensis and Stipa grandis. The climate becomes progressively drier eastward, supporting steppe and semidesert steppe. Species of Stipa are dominant, with Agropyron, Cleistogenes, Koeleria, and Leymus. Common grasses of the dry alpine steppe of the high Xizang-Qinghai Plateau include species of Elymus, Festuca, Leymus, Poa, Puccinellia, and Stipa. Desert grasses of northwest China include sand-binding species of Aeluropus, Cleistogenes, and Orinus.\r",
      "In warm, subtropical areas of southern China widespread tropical genera are well represented, including Cymbopogon, Digitaria, Eulalia, Paspalum, Pennisetum, and Setaria. The major food crop here is rice (Oryza). Other tropical genera with their center of distribution in southeast Asia extend into China, including Arundinella, Isachne, and Microstegium. Extensive pure stands of Phacelurus latifolius are found in coastal salt marshes, as are introduced species of Spartina. Phragmites species form large colonies in the shallow margins of inland lakes and rivers.\r",
      "The subfamilies of Poaceae are not included here, as they are largely based on non-morphological characters that are not readily available for identification purposes. However, the traditional grass tribes, as broadly accepted over the last two decades, do mainly have a morphological expression, backed up by characteristics of anatomy, embryology, and other cryptic characters. With practice and increasing familiarity with the family, it is usually possible to assign an unknown grass to a tribe without undue difficulty. The tribe is therefore taken as the primary division here.\r",
      "Modern molecular systematic studies are providing new insights into grass relationships. This new information has been incorporated where it has proved possible to link it to morphology, mainly by the separation of Danthonieae from Arundineae and the repositioning of a few individual genera. However, where the new information leads to the redefinition of tribes, or the genera within them, on grounds not easily expressed morphologically, the traditional treatment has been retained. Aveneae are upheld as distinct from Poeae, and Eragrostideae as distinct from Cynodonteae, because they are usually easily recognizable and hence useful for identification. Grass taxonomy is at present undergoing a period of rapid modification. The incorporation of molecular data into the classification scheme is incomplete, alterations are ongoing, and a new system with overall acceptance has not yet emerged. The primary purpose of a Flora is to provide an identification guide, usually for the non-specialist, and it must therefore be based mainly on morphology. Those interested in the latest research and new ideas on grass relationships can find more detailed information in the taxonomic literature. The following is recommended: Columbus, J.

Underground stems absent, or present and then rhizomatous or tuberous; aerial stems variously produced or not, often evergreen; bulbils for vegetative reproduction sometimes produced, e.g., on leaf or on special shoots. Leaves alternate or apparently basal, usually petiolate with sheathing bases, often subtended by prophylls and\/or cataphylls; leaf blade various, e.g., linear, simple (base often cordate to sagittate), sometimes peltate or variously compound (e.g., pinnate, radiate, pedate, or decompound), or still more complex and \"dracontioid\" (elaborate forms of sagittate, hastate, or trisect leaves in which anterior and posterior divisions are highly dissected and subdivided). Inflorescences (sometimes precocious) subtended by membranous prophylls and\/or cataphylls, consisting of a spadix subtended by a spathe. Spathe commonly with tubelike base (margins fused or not) persistent or with deciduous blade.

      "One hundred and six genera and ca. 5,400 species: worldwide except Antarctica; 33 genera and 865 species (326 endemic, five introduced) in China.",
      "Recent phylogenetic studies (e.g., D. A. Simpson et al., Aliso 23: 72-83. 2007; A. M. Muasya et al., Bot. Rev. (Lancaster) 75: 52-66. 2009) suggest that tribal and generic delimitation in Cyperaceae is likely to be modified in the future.The closest relatives to Cyperaceae are Juncaceae and Thurniaceae (D. A. Simpson in P. Rudall, P. J. Cribb, D. F. Cutler & C. J. Humphries, eds., Monocot. Syst. Evol. 2: 497-509. 1995) in the order Poales. Poaceae, which shares some characteristics of Cyperaceae, such as wind pollination and reduced floral structure, has often been placed near to Cyperaceae but is now shown to be more distantly related (H. P. Linder & E. A. Kellogg in P. Rudall et al., loc. cit.: 473-496; D. A. Simpson in P. Rudall et al., loc. cit.: 497-509).Inflorescence structure in Cyperaceae is notoriously difficult to interpret due to its highly reduced nature. Consequently, the terminology used in describing parts of the inflorescence can be confusing with several terms often being applied to the same structure. In addition, several terms are also used in the Poaceae, but they do not always relate to the same structure in both families. A laudable attempt to standardize terminology in Cyperaceae was made by I. Kukkonen (Ann. Bot. Fenn. 31: 37-43. 1994). In our treatment we have attempted to keep terminology as simple as possible.Inflorescences are generally either unbranched or very shortly branched and spicate or capitate in appearance to prominently branched and paniculate or anthelate (umbel-like), with variations around these. The basic unit of the inflorescence in most Cyperaceae is the spikelet. This comprises a very short to elongated axis, which subtends one to many scalelike bracts, referred to here as glumes. Each glume subtends and partially hides a single very small, bisexual or unisexual flower, which may or may not have a perianth. The perianth, when present, is reduced to bristles or scales. There may be 1-3 stamens and a pistil comprising an ovary, style, and 2 or 3 stigmas. The ovary gives rise to a hard, 1-seeded nutlet (sometimes referred to as an achene). Spikelets tend to be aggregated into larger structures known as spikes. In the tribe Cariceae this basic structure is modified such that the spikelet is reduced to a single flower that is enclosed by a saclike structure known as a utricle, the latter being a modified prophyll at the base of the spikelet. The utricle is subtended by a glumelike bract, and the whole structure is again aggregated with others into spikes. Some confusion arises with caricoid spikes especially as the spikelets comprise only one flower and are subtended by a glumelike bract. This has meant that spikes are sometimes referred to as spikelets and the glumelike bracts as true glumes.The spikelet is indeterminate, i.e., having no terminal flower. However, in Hypolytrum, Lepironia, and Mapania, the basic inflorescence unit has an apparently terminal female flower. To distinguish this type of unit, the term pseudospikelet is used here; some authors refer to it as a spicoid. Its structure is rather different to that of the spikelet, comprising 2-12 scalelike floral bracts on a very much reduced axis. The two lowest bracts are opposite, keeled, and often enclose the upper bracts (when the latter are present). The lower bracts subtend a male flower comprising a single stamen, the upper bracts usually being empty. The terminal flower, which is not subtended by a floral bract, is female. There are no perianth bristles or scales, and the whole structure is subtended and partially to fully hidden by a glumelike bract. These are again aggregated into spikes, but there is further confusion in terminology with the spikes sometimes being referred to as spikelets. The above interpretation of the pseudospikelet is widely accepted, although some workers have interpreted it as a single flower.One of us (Dai) believes that if Kyllinga and Pycreus are treated as separate genera from Cyperus, as they are in this treatment, then Juncellus and Mariscus should also be separated from Cyperus on account of their distinct morphological characters.Tang Tsin & Wang Fa-Tsuan. 1961. Cyperaceae (1). In: Tang Tsin & Wang Fa-Tsuan, eds., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 11: i-xv, 1-261; Liang Song-yun, Dai Lun-kai, Tang Yan-cheng & Li Pei-chun. 2000. Cyperaceae (2). In: Dai Lun-kai & Liang Song-yun, eds., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 12: i-xxii, 1-582.For accurate identification of Cyperaceae good fruiting material should be used wherever possible. Indeed this is essential in certain genera, such as Fimbristylis and Scleria. It is also important to have underground parts as these may be diagnostic for some species. Care is needed when counting the number of stigmas as these are easily broken off. Several should be observed from the same specimen. Care is also needed when counting the stamens. Anthers break off easily leaving the filaments partially hidden within the glumes. Always check that filaments are present. Also, care should be taken to distinguish perianth bristles from filaments as the number of perianth bristles may be useful in separating taxa. The bristles will usually have antrorse or retrorse hairs on them.\r",

      "In the opinion of the present authors, it is too early to decide if the Lemnaceae should be included within the Araceae. While this placement has been supported by some phylogenetic studies, only a few species of Lemnaceae have been investigated so far. Before the whole spectrum of variability of molecular characteristics of the Lemnaceae is known, it would be unwise to change the status. The Lemnaceae are a well-characterized entity of taxa, whereas the Araceae are a heterogeneous group. It is very difficult to find common characters in the Lemnaceae and Araceae. The flowering organ is not at all decisive. It is not even certain if the flowering organ of the Lemnaceae is a flower or a reduced inflorescence. It is also very difficult to find special common characters between Lemnaceae and the genera that are placed nearest to them according to phylogenetic studies.Different species of Lemnaceae are often found sympatric at the same habitats; sometimes they are associated with various kinds of aquatic ferns and vascular plants. They usually grow gregariously and with rapid reproduction (up to doubling within 24 hours). The fronds of all species are commonly utilized as high-quality feed for domestic animals, fish, and fowl.Li Hen. 1979. Lemnaceae. In: Wu Cheng yih & Li Hen, eds., Fl. Reipubl.

      "Recent analyses of orchids incorporating data from DNA analyses have confirmed many aspects of the established classifications but have also provided some surprises for orchid taxonomists. First of all, the results have upheld the monophyly (evolutionary integrity, i.e., the group includes all the taxa derived from an ancestral species) of the orchid family, including the apostasioids and cypripedioids. They also suggest strongly that the orchids are an ancient group that evolved in the great southern continent of Gondwanaland before it split up to form the southern continents of Australia, Africa, and South America, the island of Madagascar, and the subcontinent of India. The subfamilies Apostasioideae, Cypripedioideae, and Orchidoideae (sensu Dressler, Phylogeny Classific. Orchid Fam. 1993) are all monophyletic. However, recent work clearly shows that Vanilla and its relatives form a separate and ancient clade (an evolutionary lineage including all the taxa derived from a single ancestral one) that deserves recognition as the subfamily Vanilloideae, that the Spiranthoideae nest within a more broadly defined Orchidoideae, and that Vandoideae are a specialized clade within a more broadly defined Epidendroideae.A detailed new classification of the orchid family is currently being produced under the title Genera Orchidacearum, of which four of the six volumes have been published and a fifth is near completion (Pridgeon et al., Gen. Orchid. 1-4(1). 1999-2005). Even when this work is completed, such is the speed with which new information and techniques are being developed and published, it will almost certainly require revision. However, we now have the broad bones of a more robust and predictive classification of the family that will be more satisfactory than the presently widely used systems that are based mainly upon morphological characters.The classification of the family is currently the subject of some debate, particularly the circumscription and the placement of certain tribes, subtribes, and genera. The classification of Chase et al. (in Dixon et al., Orchid Conservation, 69-89. 2003), elaborated in Pridgeon et al. (loc. cit.), which is strongly supported by recent molecular, embryological, and morphological analyses, is followed here. They recognize five subfamilies: Apostasioideae, Cypripedioideae, Vanilloideae, Orchidoideae, and Epidendroideae.Lang Kaiyong, Chen Singchi, Luo Yibo & Zhu Guanghua. 1999. Orchidaceae (1).
